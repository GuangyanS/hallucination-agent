Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 90 (C) 180 (D) 270\nA: The angle between two lines is defined as the angle between the two lines with respect to each other. The angle between the two lines is given by the formula: Angle = tan^-1 (1/(x1 - x2)), where x1 and x2 are the slopes of the two lines. In this case, we have two lines: x = 4 and y = 0. We want to find the time when this angle has a measure of 90 degrees. So, we need to find the time when x = 4 and y = 0 simultaneously. We can substitute x = 4 and y = 0 into the formula for the angle: Angle = tan^-1 (1/4). This expression is undefined because the tan^-1 function is defined only for angles in the interval (0, \u03c0/2), which is not the case here. This indicates that our calculations have resulted in an error. If we substitute x = 4 and y = 0 into the formula for the angle again, we get Angle = tan^-1 (1/4). However, this expression is still undefined because the tan^-1 function is defined only for angles in the interval (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), which is not the case here. This indicates that our calculations have resulted in an error. If we substitute x = 4 and y = 0 into the formula for the angle one more time, we get Angle = tan^-1 (1/4).
