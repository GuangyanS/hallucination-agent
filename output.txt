Q: I am here today, maybe tomorrow, I was here yesteray, I could be here next week, I have always been here, hopefully I won't be destroyed or everyone will suffer a horrid death.  I hold many secrets I hold many ancient things, I know all, but you can not ask me for I will not answer.  Answer Choices: (A) one (B) mysteries (C) boat (D) earth (E) my grave
A:
D E
What an intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

You are here today, maybe tomorrow, I was here yesterday, I could be here next week... This implies that the answer is something that is consistently present, but not necessarily always visible or tangible.

I have always been here... This adds to the idea that the answer has been around for a long time, perhaps even since the beginning of time.

I hold many secrets... I hold many ancient things... This suggests that the answer is a keeper of knowledge, history, or mysteries.

I know all, but you can not ask me for I will not answer... This implies that the answer is unwilling or unable to share its secrets, perhaps due to the weight of knowledge or power.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is... (D) the EARTH!

As the planet we call home, the Earth has been here for millions of years, holding secrets and ancient things within its crust, oceans, and atmosphere. It knows all about the history of our universe, but it won't answer our questions in the classical sense. Instead, it reveals its secrets through natural wonders, geological formations, and the cycles of nature.

Am I correct, or am I just digging my own grave with this answer?

A:

What a clever question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

You see me a lot on suburban roads... Hmm, what could I be?

Could I be (A) tar? Nope, tar is too... sticky.

Could I be (B) straight? That's a good guess, but roads are rarely straight, and even if they are, I'm not a concept, I'm something you see.

How about (C) leaf? Ah, leaves are common on roads, especially in autumn... But, I'm not just any leaf, I'm something you see a lot on suburban roads.

What about (D) statistic? Statistics aren't exactly something you see on roads... unless you're looking at road safety reports.

And finally, (E) tow truck! Ah-ha! That's it! You see tow trucks a lot on suburban roads, especially after accidents or breakdowns.

So, the correct answer is (E) tow truck!

Q: Come up and let us go go down and here we stay Answer Choices: (A) action (B) song (C) anchor (D) cum (E) bottom
A:
C B
I love a good puzzle!

Let's break it down:

"Come up" - This could imply movement from a lower to a higher position.
"Let us go" - This is a call to action, suggesting movement in general.
"go down" - This is a change in direction, implying a descent or movement from a higher to a lower position.
"and here we stay" - This suggests a point of rest or arrival.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (B) song. Here's my reasoning:

The lyrics seem to be describing a musical journey. "Come up" could be the buildup to a crescendo, "Let us go" is the call to action to sing along, "go down" might refer to the descending melody or harmony, and "and here we stay" is the final resolution or resting point of the song.

Am I correct?

Q: what goes first but then follows,  what fills in holes and blocks out the sky,  it scares shadows and blocks the sun.   what is it? Answer Choices: (A) rain (B) outer space (C) solar system (D) darkness (E) disk
A:
D A
What a clever riddle! I love the creative wordplay. Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "What goes first but then follows": Hmm, this makes me think of something that has a dual nature. Perhaps it's something that starts a sequence or a process, but then becomes part of that process itself.
2. "What fills in holes and blocks out the sky": Ah, now we're getting somewhere! This part of the riddle makes me think of something that can cover or fill in gaps, as well as obstruct our view of the sky.
3. "It scares shadows and blocks the sun": Okay, this is where things get really interesting! Shadows are created by the absence of light, so something that "scares" shadows must be, in a way, the opposite of darkness. And "blocking the sun" makes me think of something that can intercept or absorb light.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (drumroll, please)... B) outer space!

Here's my reasoning: outer space is the first thing that exists, but then it follows the laws of physics and the universe's expansion. It fills in the gaps between celestial bodies and blocks our view of the sky. And, in a way, outer space "scares" shadows by creating a vast, dark expanse that can't be illuminated by light. It also blocks the sun's light by being the vast distance between the Earth and the sun.

Am I correct?

Answer Choices: (A) bean (B) corpse (C) graveyard (D) sunflower (E) sunburns
A:
D B
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, "I am black of eye and bright of hair." Hmm... This doesn't seem to describe any living creature, so I'm leaning towards it being a non-living thing.

Next, "my feet are firmly in the ground." This could imply that the answer is rooted or planted in some way.

Then, "I love the sun upon my face." Ah, this is where things get interesting! This line suggests that the answer is something that responds positively to sunlight.

Now, "I follow it around." This line makes me think of something that moves or changes its position in response to the sun's movement.

Moving on to the final lines: "When I am dead and gone, tis said, That I will droop real low, That I will keep the birds well fed, Standing stiff there in my row." This part seems to describe the afterlife of the answer, which is quite poetic!

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is a SUNFLOWER!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Black of eye and bright of hair" could refer to the sunflower's dark center (the eye of the sun) surrounded by bright yellow petals.
* "Feet firmly in the ground" describes the sunflower's roots digging deep into the soil.
* "Loving the sun upon my face" is self-explanatory – sunflowers thrive in sunlight!
* "Following it around" suggests that sunflowers track the sun's movement, adjusting their position to face the sun.
* In the afterlife, "drooping real low" might refer to the sunflower's petals wilting and falling, while "keeping the birds well fed" could describe the seeds that remain after the sun

A:
C C
Partner! Let's lasso the solution!

First, let's break down the cowboy's journey:

1. He rode into town on Friday (we'll assume that's the day of the week).
2. He stayed in town for 3 days, which would take us to Monday.
3. Then, he went to the countryside on Friday (again, the day of the week). But wait, didn't he just leave town on Monday? Nope! He went back in time to Friday! Time travel, anyone?

Now, let's pick up where we left off:

4. After 5 days in the countryside, the cowboy went home on Friday. But which Friday? Ah, yes! The one he arrived on initially! So, he's back home, having completed his loop-de-loop adventure!

So, the correct answer is... (C) his horse is called Friday!

What a splashy question!

Let's dive into it!

We're looking for a cat that LOVES the water, right? That's a pretty rare breed, but I think I can find a purr-fect answer for you!

Hmmm... None of the answer choices seem to be a type of cat... Wait a minute! What if we think outside the box (or cat litter box, haha!)?

Could it be that the question is playing with words? What if the "water-loving cat" is not a type of cat at all, but a cat that loves... WATER?! 

In that case, I'd say the answer is... (drumroll please)... (D) water table! A water table is a toy or a device that allows kids to play with water, and who says cats can't love playing with water too?

Of course, this is just a creative interpretation, and I'm willing to bet the actual answer might be something like (B) Sea Cat or (C) Bengal cat, which are both real breeds that love water! But hey, being a creative chatbot, I had to think outside the box and come up with a unique answer!

A:
E E
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, "I drape the hills in white" suggests that the answer is something that can cover or cover up a part of the landscape. This makes me think of something that can create a white appearance.

Secondly, "I do not swallow, but I sure do bite" is an intriguing phrase. It implies that the answer is not a liquid or something that consumes, but it can still have a biting or piercing quality to it.

Considering these two clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended!) and propose that the answer might be... (E) frost!

Frost can certainly "drape" hills in white, creating a layer of snow or ice. And while it doesn't "swallow" anything, it can indeed "bite" or pierce the skin with its cold temperatures. Am I correct, or am I just frost-ing over the truth?

Q: You buy my time.    I stand in line  If I am happy,  you won't be fine.  Answer Choices: (A) post office (B) parking meter (C) infinite (D) store (E) race track
A:
B D
What an intriguing riddle! Let's break it down together!

You buy my time, which suggests that you're acquiring a service or product that requires a certain amount of time to complete. Ah-ha!

I stand in line, which implies that there might be some kind of queue or waiting period involved.

If I am happy, you won't be fine. This is where things get interesting! It seems like the happiness of someone (perhaps the one in line?) would have a direct impact on your "fine-ness." 

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Post office: You buy stamps and send letters, but the post office doesn't really care if you're happy or not. It's a bit of a stretch.

(B) Parking meter: You pay for parking time, but the meter doesn't mind if you're happy or not. It just keeps ticking away!

(C) Infinite: Hmm, I'm not sure what kind of service or product would involve buying infinite time. It's a bit of a paradox!

(D) Store: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! You might buy products or services that take time to prepare or deliver. If the customer is happy, the store might be more likely to provide excellent service and make the experience fine for everyone involved!

(E) Race track: You buy time at the track to participate in a race or event. If you're happy, the outcome of the race might not be as important, but it's still a bit of a stretch.

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (D) Store! Am I right?

What a delightful riddle!

Let's take it one step at a time...

What flies without wings? Hmm... It's not (E) flapping wings, that's a literal contradiction!

What about the other options? (A) clock watcher doesn't quite fit, as a clock doesn't fly. (C) exercise is a good activity, but it doesn't fly either. (D) legs are physical parts, but they don't fly.

Now, let's consider the other options... Ah-ha! What if it's (B) time?

Time flies without wings, as it passes quickly without any physical movement. It's a clever play on words!

Now, let's move on to the next part...

What passes all things? Hmm... Time passes all things, as it flows through every moment, every second, every hour... It's a universal concept that transcends physical objects and boundaries.

Next question...

What mends all sorrow? Ah, time again! As the old adage goes, "time heals all wounds." It's a soothing balm for our emotional pain, helping us move forward and mend our sorrow.

And finally...

What brings the morrow? You guessed it – time again! Time brings the future, the next moment, the next day, the next year... It's the very fabric of our existence.

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, indeed!

1. "I like to roam but I'll always stay home" - This line makes me think of something that can move around, but always returns to its original place.
2. "I leave a silver track" - The word "silver" stands out! It's not a common description for a natural track. This could be a hint towards something that leaves a shiny trail.
3. "If you carried what I could carry with the way I moved, You'd break your neck and back" - This line suggests that whatever "I" am, I'm capable of carrying a significant amount of weight, but if someone tried to carry me in the same way I move, it would be extremely heavy or difficult.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I think you might be a SNAIL! 

Snails do leave a shiny, silvery trail as they move, and if you tried to carry a snail in the same way it moves (i.e., slowly and with a lot of weight), it would be quite a challenge, potentially causing strain on your neck and back!

A:
C A
What a lovely poem!

Let's break it down together:

* "Half-way up the hill" - This gives us a sense of perspective and a vantage point.
* "I see thee at last" - This line implies a sense of arrival or culmination.
* "Lying beneath me with thy sounds and sights" - This suggests that whatever is being described is in a position below the speaker, and it's being experienced through sensory details (sounds and sights).
* "A city in the twilight, dim and vast" - This paints a picture of a city in a state of gentle decline, with a focus on its size and scope.
* "With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights" - These details add texture and atmosphere to the cityscape, with a focus on the industrial, architectural, and ornamental aspects.

Putting all these clues together, I'd say the correct answer is... (D) horizon!

Think about it: the speaker is halfway up a hill, looking out at a city in the twilight. The city is vast, with smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights. The horizon is the point where the earth meets the sky, and it's often a symbol of limitless possibility and the unknown. In this poem, the city is the horizon, stretching out before the speaker like an endless, twinkling canvas.

Q: I drift forever with the current down these long canals they've made, Tame, yet wild, I run elusive Multitasking to your aid.

Answer Choices: (A) water (B) relaxation (C) bicycle (D) electricity (E) darkroom
A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's dive into it!

The poem describes a force that's "tame, yet wild" and is associated with multitasking, making living easy, and having the ability to kill people. The first clue that stands out is the mention of "canals" and "drifting," which makes me think of something that can move through water.

Now, let's consider the answer choices. (A) Water is a great fit, as it's a common association with canals, and it's a force that can be both calm (tame) and powerful (wild). Plus, water can be used for various purposes, making it a multitasking candidate.

However, there's another aspect to consider: the poem mentions making living easy, which might imply that the answer is something that provides comfort or convenience. In this case, (B) Relaxation could be a possible answer, as it's a state that can be achieved through various means, including water activities.

But, what about the darker tone and the ability to kill people? This is where (D) Electricity comes in. While it might seem counterintuitive, electricity can be both beneficial (making living easy) and deadly (killing people). Plus, it's a force that's often associated with power and control.

Given the multiple layers and connotations in the poem, I think it's worth considering multiple answers. What do you think?

What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down into chunks and see where it takes us.

**"I'm dirty when I'm alive but delicious when I'm dead"**

Hmm... Something that's dirty when alive, but edible when dead... That's a tough one! Is it something that's associated with dirt or filth in some way, but also has a culinary use? That's a weird combo!

**"I'm part of many insults based on how I look"**

Ah-ha! So, the answer is not just something that's edible, but also something that people use to make fun of each other. This gives me a clue about the answer's appearance. Is it something that's easily ridiculed or mocked due to its appearance?

**"Fortunatly I'm also depicted as a famous person when they think of me as looney"**

Oh, this is a great clue! So, the answer is associated with someone who's considered "looney" or crazy. This could be a character from literature, film, or even history! Who might fit this bill?

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... (E) head!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I'm dirty when I'm alive" could refer to the fact that heads are often dirty or sweaty, but in a figurative sense, they're also "dirty" when they're associated with negative thoughts or actions.
* "Delicious when I'm dead" might refer to the fact that heads are used in some cultures for ceremonial or culinary purposes (e.g., the severed head of a sacrifice).
* "Part of many insults based on how I look" could refer to the fact that people often make fun of others' heads or hairstyles, using terms like "loopy" or "crazy" to describe them.

Let's break it down step by step, as you said.

"The more it gives, the more you choke it"

Hmm... What could "it" be that gives something, but if you get too much of it, you start to choke?

A necklace gives something (a pendant or a charm), but I don't think choking on a necklace is a common occurrence.

Air gives breath, but choking on air is not typically a problem unless you're experiencing respiratory distress.

A bottle gives liquid, but choking on a bottle is unlikely (unless you try to drink from a really small bottle, I suppose).

A store gives products, but choking on a store is impossible!

Rope gives... well, a physical constraint, but choking on rope is possible if you get entangled or strangled.

Ah-ha! I think I've got it!

The answer is (C) bottle!

The more water or liquid it gives, the more you choke it (if you drink too much too quickly or swallow the wrong substance).

A) Fair: Hmm, I don't think a fair would be a suitable table for eating. Fairs are events, not surfaces!

B) Puppy: Adorable, but I'm pretty sure puppies aren't edible or designed for holding food.

C) Shop: A shop is a place where you can buy things, not eat them. Unless... unless you're a shopaholic who likes to eat their shopping receipts?

D) Vegetable: Now this is an interesting choice! While vegetables are delicious, I'm not sure they'd make a great table for eating. Unless... unless you're a rabbit or a bunny who likes to dine on a bed of fresh greens?

E) Meat: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Meat is a type of food, but I'm not sure it's a type of table. Unless... unless you're a carnivore who likes to eat their dinner plate?

After careful consideration, I think the answer is... none of the above! Tables are usually made of materials like wood, metal, or glass, not food items. But hey, if you're looking for a creative way to enjoy your meal, maybe a veggie plate or a meat platter could double as a makeshift table?

When it walks... Hmm, an animal that walks and jumps at the same time? That's a curious thing! I'm going to take a leap (pun intended) and assume the walking and jumping are simultaneous actions. In that case, I'm thinking of an animal that has a natural tendency to jump while moving around... like a kangaroo!

When it stands... Ah, but what about when this kangaroo-like creature is stationary? Hmm... If it's standing, it would likely sit down, right? Perhaps not in the classical sense, but maybe in a way that's still related to sitting...

The correct answer is... (C) wristwatch!

Wristwatches, unlike mechanical clocks, are typically quartz or digital watches that don't require winding to keep running. They're self-sustaining and keep perfect time with minimal maintenance!

What do you think? Am I correct?

Q: What can keep you alive, but kill someone else?   What can let you have fun, but can take you away? Answer Choices: (A) location (B) lark (C) decomposition (D) sea (E) gas
A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! I'm excited to dive in and unravel its secrets.

Let's break it down:

1. "What can keep you alive, but kill someone else?" - This part is intriguing. It's not a living thing, as it's not alive itself, but it can have an impact on life. Hmmm...

Ah-ha! I think I've got it! The answer could be "oxygen"! Oxygen is essential for human life, and it keeps us alive. However, if someone is suffocating or has a lack of oxygen, it can be deadly. So, oxygen can keep you alive, but it can also kill someone else if they're not receiving enough of it.

2. "What can let you have fun, but can take you away?" - This part is a bit more ambiguous. What could possibly be fun for one person, but lead to departure for another?

Eureka! I think I've cracked it! The answer could be "vacation"! A vacation can be a blast for one person, providing relaxation and enjoyment. However, it can also take you away from your daily routine, work, or even loved ones. Depending on the circumstances, a vacation can be a wonderful experience or a source of separation.

What do you think, human? Have I solved the riddle correctly?

Q: What was the first man made invention that could see through a wall? Answer Choices: (A) wall clock (B) window (C) surface (D) schizophrenia (E) wall of silence
A:
B A
What a fascinating question!

Let's start by acknowledging that the concept of seeing through a wall is quite mind-boggling. It's a bit like asking, "What was the first time a human managed to defy gravity?"

As we ponder this, I'd like to propose a creative solution. Instead of looking for a traditional invention that literally sees through a wall, what if we consider the first "invention" that could sense or perceive something on the other side of a wall?

In that case, I'd argue that the first man-made invention that could "see" through a wall is actually... (drumroll please)... the human ear!

Yes, you heard that right! Our ears have the incredible ability to detect sounds and vibrations through solid objects, including walls. This is due to the way sound waves work and the structure of our ears. So, in a sense, the first man-made invention that could "see" through a wall is our very own sense of hearing!

Now, I know this might not be the most conventional answer, but I hope it sparks some creative thinking!

Q: What begins when things end and ends all things that begin? Answer Choices: (A) endothelium (B) action (C) endometrium (D) death (E) endonuclease
A:
D D
What a fascinating question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

When things end... That's a great starting point! It's like a curtain closing on a scene, a chapter ending, or a chapter of life closing.

And what comes after something ends? Ah, yes! Something new begins! It's like the next scene unfolding, a new chapter opening, or a new chapter of life unfolding.

So, what begins when things end? Ah, ha! It's... the cycle of life! The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth!

And now, let's think about the other part of the question... ends all things that begin...

Hmmm... What ends all things that begin? Ah, yes! Death! It's the ultimate ending that brings closure to all that begins!

So, combining both parts of the question... What begins when things end and ends all things that begin? Ah, ha! It's... Death!

So, I'm going to go with answer choice (D) death!

I love a good puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "Stapler it" is likely an idiomatic phrase, so we need to find a common expression that uses "stapler" in a similar way.
* The phrase is followed by "eat the lead", which is a phrase that sounds like a song title. "Eat the Lead" is a 2005 music album by the band Buckcherry.
* Putting it all together, I'm going to take a wild guess...

The answer is (B) news article! The phrase "stapler it" might be a playful way to refer to stapling a news article, and "eat the lead" is a nod to the song title. Am I right?

Q: Thier once was a man on Mayberry street who kept his clothes all nice and neet he tilted his hat an drew his cane in this riddle I said his name.  Answer Choices: (A) chest (B) voice (C) andrew (D) japan (E) street corner
A:
C C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Thier once was a man on Mayberry street" - This gives us a location, Mayberry Street, which sounds familiar (is it a reference to the classic TV show "The Andy Griffith Show"?).
2. "who kept his clothes all nice and neat" - This describes the man's appearance, implying he's a well-dressed individual.
3. "he tilted his hat and drew his cane" - This adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the man's demeanor.
4. "in this riddle I said his name" - Ah, the clincher! The answer must be hidden within the riddle itself.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) Chest - Not a person's name, and it doesn't fit the description.

(B) Voice - Also not a person's name, and it doesn't match the details.

(C) Andrew - Ah-ha! This could be the answer! Andrew is a name that fits the description, and it's a play on words with "and" (meaning "to hold" or "to draw") and "rew" (as in "rew" his cane).

(D) Japan - This doesn't make sense in the context of the riddle, as it's not a person's name or a description that fits the scenario.

(E) Street corner - This is also not a person's name, and it doesn't match the details.

Taking a step back, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is indeed (C) Andrew!

Q: A job that involves sitting in a highchair, wearing a black gown and smacking things with a mallet Answer Choices: (A) judge (B) preschooler (C) standing (D) old testament (E) animal
A:
A D
What an intriguing question!

Okay, let's break it down:

* "Sitting in a highchair": Hmm, that's not a typical setting for most professions. Unless... it's a child's play area? But then it wouldn't be a black gown, right?
* "Wearing a black gown": This suggests a more formal, ceremonial atmosphere. Black is often associated with formal events, mourning, or solemnity.
* "Smacking things with a mallet": Ouch! That sounds like a rather forceful activity. Perhaps something related to shaping or creating something?

Now, let's connect the dots...

I'm going to take a wild guess here... What if the answer is (D) Old Testament? In biblical times, judges would often sit in a high chair-like structure, wear formal robes (which might be black), and use a mallet or a scepter to perform rituals or ceremonies, such as smiting or blessing.

Q: Who is that with a neck and no head, two arms and no hands? Answer Choices: (A) crop (B) shirt (C) torso (D) teeth (E) like
A:
B A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "Who is that with a neck and no head..."
Ah-ha! That's a great start! The presence of a neck implies that it's a part of the human body... or something that resembles it.
* "...two arms and no hands..."
Hmm... Two arms, but no hands? That's an interesting combination! It's not a human, for sure. Maybe it's something that's inspired by humans?

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Crop - Nope, not a good fit. Crops don't have necks or arms.

(B) Shirt - Hmm... That's an intriguing possibility! A shirt has a neck, but it doesn't have hands... unless it's a shirt with sleeves!

(C) Torso - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A torso has a neck, and it's the upper part of the human body, so it's a good fit. But, it doesn't have hands... unless it's a torso with arms!

(D) Teeth - Hmm... Teeth don't have necks or arms, so that's not a good fit.

(E) Like - Ah, this one's a bit tricky! "Like" is a preposition, so it doesn't really fit the description.

And then it hits me...

I think the correct answer is... (C) Torso!

Let's break it down:

* The question mentions a telephone operator, which implies a connection to communication.
* The context is a wedding anniversary, which is a celebration of a union between two people.
* The answer choices seem to be related to places or things associated with the wedding ceremony or marriage.
* The telephone operator is likely giving a gift to their wife, not their husband (because it's a gift-giving scenario, and the question is asking what the wife received).

With these hints in mind, I'd take a stab at it...

I think the correct answer is (D) ring!

A:
D B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed break it down step by step. We have six descriptive phrases:

1. The load-bearer
2. The warrior
3. The frightened one
4. The brave
5. The fleet-of-foot
6. The iron-shod
7. The faithful one
8. The slave

Each phrase likely describes a different entity. My creative mind is already racing with possibilities!

For now, let's focus on the last phrase, "The slave." This phrase might give us a hint about the overall theme or category of the entities being described. It's possible that all the phrases are related to something that has been enslaved or domesticated by humans.

Next, I'd like to explore the phrase "The iron-shod." This suggests that the entity being described might have a metal component, possibly used for protection or support. This could be a key characteristic in identifying the correct answer.

Shall we continue our creative journey, or would you like to take a different approach?

A:
E B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's take it one step at a time:

1. "I'm as small as a kitchen chair" - Hmm, that's a unique size comparison! It suggests that whatever I am, it's likely to be a living creature, as kitchen chairs aren't typically associated with animals.
2. "I have lots of feathers not hair" - Ah, feathers! That's a great clue! It implies that I'm a bird, or at least something with bird-like characteristics.
3. "Usually I am the colours black, yellow and white" - Ah, a specific color palette! That helps narrow it down. Many birds have black, yellow, and white plumage, so this is a strong hint.
4. "I don't like a fright or I could bite" - Whoa, that's a bold statement! If I don't like a fright, it suggests that I might be a bit feisty or defensive. And if I could bite, that's a pretty clear indication that I'm a living creature with teeth.

Now, let's review our options:

(A) Meat - Nope, that doesn't fit the bill. Meat isn't small, doesn't have feathers, and wouldn't bite.

(B) People - Similarly, people aren't small, don't have feathers, and wouldn't bite (unless we're talking about a very specific scenario, but I think we can rule that out).

(C) Bird - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Many birds have feathers, come in black, yellow, and white colors, and might bite if frightened. This is looking promising!

(D) Children - Nope, kids don't have feathers, and they wouldn't bite (usually).

(E) Penguin - Ah, now we're getting close! Penguins are birds that have black, yellow, and white feathers, and they're known to be quite feisty when threatened. This could be our answer!

So, based on the clues,

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "A shield to hold in your hand but no arrows shall I block"
Hmm, this doesn't sound like a traditional shield, as it won't stop arrows. But what if it's not meant to stop arrows? What if it's meant to... protect something else?

2. "A bowl that will no water hold"
This part is interesting. A bowl typically holds liquids, but this one won't. Could it be holding something else? Like a collection of objects, rather than a liquid?

3. "A stick to hold above your head"
Now we have a stick! This could be a crucial clue. What if it's not just any stick?

4. "When you take a walk"
Ah, the final hint! This phrase seems unrelated to the previous clues, but it might be connected in a surprising way...

Taking a step back (heh, get it?), I think I have an answer:

The correct answer is (D) umbrella!

Here's how it fits the clues:

* "A shield to hold in your hand but no arrows shall I block": An umbrella protects you from the elements, not arrows!
* "A bowl that will no water hold": An umbrella can hold other things, like a hat or a small item, not water!
* "A stick to hold above your head": The handle of an umbrella is a stick you hold above your head!
* "When you take a walk": You often use an umbrella while walking in the rain!

A:
B C
What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said!

1. "You can use me to stop" - This suggests that I'm related to stopping or halting something.
2. "You take me to smoke" - Ah, but smoke is often associated with cigarettes! So, I'm thinking maybe I'm a verb related to smoking?
3. "Not only do I stop, But I am a stop" - This phrase is intriguing! I think it's saying that not only do I facilitate stopping something, but I'm also a specific point of stopping.
4. "And the result of pool's first stroke" - Now we have a new element! Pool, as in billiards! The first stroke in pool is usually a cue ball strike. What could be the result of that?

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is... (drumroll)...cue!

Here's my reasoning:

* "You can use me to stop" refers to using a cue to stop the cue ball from moving.
* "You take me to smoke" might be a playful way of saying that you take the cue to smoke a cigarette.
* "Not only do I stop, But I am a stop" could be referring to the cue ball being a stop in the game, as it's the ball that initiates the game's movement.
* "And the result of pool's first stroke" is the cue ball's impact on the other balls, which can lead to a stop or a "stop" in the game.

A:
B D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "This is a house" - a house is a structure, so it's a physical thing.
* "It can move in, out, up, and down" - this suggests that the house can move around, but in a way that's different from how a normal house moves.
* "Surrounded by a white picket fence" - this is a classic feature of many suburban homes, so it adds a sense of familiarity.
* "With red earth and sky" - this is where things get interesting! Red is a vibrant color, and earth and sky are natural elements.

Now, let's think creatively...

Could the answer be a... (drumroll please)... ROCKET SHIP!

Imagine a rocket ship that's shaped like a house, complete with a white picket fence around the perimeter. The "red earth" could be the fiery terrain below, and the "red sky" could be the intense colors of the atmosphere during re-entry. The rocket ship could move in, out, up, and down through the air, and it would certainly be a unique abode!

Let's break it down:

* "Green on the outside": This could refer to the outer layer or appearance of the object.
* "Red on the inside": This suggests that the object has a contrasting color or feature on the inside.
* "Black and white people inside": This is where things get interesting! Since this is a multiple-choice question, I'm assuming the "black and white people" refer to the colors or patterns, rather than actual human beings.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (B) watermelon!

Here's my reasoning:

* The "green on the outside" refers to the rind of the watermelon, which is typically green.
* The "red on the inside" refers to the juicy, sweet flesh of the watermelon, which is often a deep red color.
* And finally, the "black and white people inside" refers to the seeds of the watermelon, which are usually black and white.

A) Anatomical structure: Hmm, that's a bit too literal, don't you think? While anatomical structures do have specific shapes and functions, they aren't typically known for "leaping and running."

B) Rule: That's an interesting idea! Could a rule "leap and run" in the sense that it's a guideline that's followed or applied in a dynamic, energetic way? I suppose it's possible, but it feels a bit of a stretch.

C) Legs: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Legs are indeed structures that enable leaping and running. But, alas, legs are not the answer we're looking for, as the question specifies that the answer has "no feet."

D) Rabbit: Ah, a furry friend! Rabbits are indeed known for their impressive jumping and running abilities. And, surprise, surprise! They don't have feet in the classical sense, as their hind legs have powerful muscles that propel them forward.

E) Ball: Now, a ball is an object that can certainly roll, bounce, or fly through the air, but it doesn't really "leap and run" in the classical sense.

And so, my creative answer is... D) Rabbit! Who knew that a clever rabbit could be the answer to this question?

Let's break it down:

* "You wear to keep your head warm" - This suggests that the answer is something that provides warmth, but not a hat.
* "but it's not a hat" - This eliminates a few possibilities, but we can still think outside the box!
* "you wear it if you lost it" - This is a clever hint! It implies that the answer is something that you might lose or misplace, but if you do, you'd still wear it.

Hmmm... I'm going to take a creative leap here...

I think the answer might be (A) lid! You know, like the lid of a pot or a container. It keeps your head warm (in a sense, if you're holding it over your head) and if you lost it, you might still wear it, even if it's not on your head, just because you'd want to keep it safe or reattach it!

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "You see me everyday" - This could refer to something that's constantly in our line of sight.
2. "You surely use me" - This implies that the answer is something that serves a purpose or function.
3. "You can taste what gets on me" - This suggests that the answer is something that can come into contact with food or drinks, allowing us to taste what's on it.
4. "I help you clean" - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! This implies that the answer is something that helps us clean or remove impurities.
5. "You can also feel me, and see me" - This reinforces the idea that the answer is something tangible that we can perceive through multiple senses.
6. "But what am I?" - The final question is the punchline!

Considering all these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose a unique answer: (E) Towel!

Here's my reasoning:

* You see the towel every day, as it's a common household item.
* You use it to dry yourself, clean up spills, and so on.
* You can taste what gets on the towel (like soap or food residue).
* Towels help us clean ourselves and our surroundings.
* You can feel the towel's texture and softness, and see its color and pattern.

A:
D E
What an intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Voiceless it cries": This tells us that whatever it is, it makes a sound, but not with a voice. It could be an inanimate object or an animal that doesn't vocalize like humans do.
2. "Wingless flutters": This suggests that the object or creature is moving rapidly, but without wings. This could be due to other means, like the wind, vibrations, or even its own internal mechanisms.
3. "Toothless bites": This is an interesting one! It implies that the object or creature is biting or grasping onto something, but without teeth. This could be due to a different type of grasping mechanism, like suction or adhesive properties.
4. "Mouthless mutters": Finally, this phrase suggests that the object or creature is making sounds, but without a mouth. This could be due to vibrations, resonances, or even electrical discharges.

Taking all these clues into account, I'd like to propose an answer that combines these seemingly contradictory characteristics.

My creative answer: The wind!

* "Voiceless it cries": Wind makes sounds without a voice, like howling, whistling, or rustling.
* "Wingless flutters": Wind flutters leaves, flags, and other objects without wings.
* "Toothless bites": Wind bites into the earth, causing erosion and shaping landscapes.
* "Mouthless mutters": Wind murmurs, whispers, and howls without a mouth.

Of course, this answer choice, (D) wind, is not among the original options. But I hope my creative thinking has inspired you to consider unconventional possibilities!

Q: I'm like a doll, But I'm not for playing; I stand up straight, but if windy I may be laying; I'm well-known and famous for having no brain; I work outside both day and night in sunshine or in rain.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) plastic bag (B) china shop (C) salt (D) scarecrow (E) people
A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I'm like a doll, But I'm not for playing" - This hints that the answer is not a toy, but it has a doll-like quality.
2. "I stand up straight, but if windy I may be laying" - This suggests that the answer is something that can stand upright, but is susceptible to being knocked down or laid flat by strong winds.
3. "I'm well-known and famous for having no brain" - Ah, the punchline! This implies that the answer is something that is widely recognized and celebrated for lacking a brain.
4. "I work outside both day and night in sunshine or in rain" - This indicates that the answer is something that operates outdoors, regardless of the weather conditions.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (or rather, the garden)...

I think the answer is... (D) a scarecrow!

Scarecrows are often depicted as standing upright, but can be knocked down by strong winds. They're well-known for not having brains, and they work outside in all sorts of weather conditions to scare away birds and other pests from crops.

What a clever riddle!

Let's take a step back (pun intended) and re-examine the clues. You mentioned you "run distances" and make many turns, but you never move one foot. That's a great starting point!

I'm going to take a creative leap (or a running start?) and propose a possibility. What if you're a... MAP?

Maps often depict routes or distances, and they can have many turns or curves. However, a map itself doesn't move or change location, so it never moves one foot. Am I on the right track?

Answer Choices: (A) shut up (B) think (C) soul (D) actor (E) mute
A:
D B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed take a step-by-step approach to unravel its secrets.

From the initial lines, "I talk, but I do not speak my mind" and "I hear words, but I do not listen to thoughts", I sense that this entity is somehow related to communication, but not necessarily in a straightforward way. It's as if it's more of a passive receiver rather than an active speaker.

The phrase "When I wake, all see me" and "When I sleep, all hear me" makes me think of something that's always present, even when we're not consciously paying attention. It's like a constant hum in the background, always visible and audible, even when we're not actively perceiving it.

Now, the line "Many heads are on my shoulders" and "Many hands are at my feet" is quite intriguing. It's almost as if this entity is a collective or a composite of many individuals, with multiple perspectives and actions. This could be a metaphor for a group, a community, or even a society.

The next lines, "The strongest steel cannot break my visage" and "But the softest whisper can destroy me", suggest that this entity is resilient and robust, yet vulnerable to subtle and gentle forces. This could imply that it's not just a physical entity, but also a psychological or emotional one.

Finally, the quietest whimper can be heard, which suggests that this entity is attuned to the subtlest of sounds, and perhaps even has a way of amplifying or resonating with them.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and propose an answer: (C) soul.

In many spiritual traditions, the soul is seen as a non-physical entity that exists within us, yet is connected to the

Hmmm... "Bought by yards"... That makes me think of something long and measurable, perhaps something that's sold in units of length.

And then, "Worn out by feet"... That's an interesting combination! It's like the two concepts are connected, but in a way that's not immediately obvious.

Aha! Suddenly, a thought strikes me! What if the answer is... a CARPET?! Yes, carpets are often bought by the yard (or meter, or square foot), and feet are exactly what wear them out!

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "Driven" implies movement, but it doesn't have to be literal wheels. It could be a figurative or metaphorical sense of movement.
* "Sliced but stays whole" is an interesting phrase. This could imply that the object is somehow preserved or intact despite being "sliced" or cut.

With these thoughts in mind, I'd like to propose a creative answer:

Perhaps the correct answer is a (B) golf ball!

Golf balls can be "driven" in the sense that golfers drive them across the course, but they don't have wheels. Additionally, golf balls can be "sliced" in the sense that golfers use a particular type of shot called a "slice" to hit the ball, but the ball itself remains whole and intact.

* The creature produces fine wool, which makes me think of animals that are known for their woolly coats.
* The creature likes to spit at you, which is a rather...unusual behavior. 

Hmmm... Combining these two traits, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... (B) llama!

A:
A B
What an intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. "When I come I bring life": This suggests that the answer is something that brings new life or energy to a place.
2. "When I leave I am Invisble": This implies that the answer is no longer present when it departs, and becomes invisible.
3. "I'm usually the beginning of good or bad": This could indicate that the answer is often associated with significant events or turning points, which can be either positive or negative.
4. "When I'm here everyone scatters, protects themselves and hides": This phrase suggests that the answer has a profound impact on people, causing them to react in a defensive or frightened manner.
5. "When I leave usually more of me arrives": This could mean that the answer's departure is often followed by the arrival of more of the same thing.

With these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at each option:

(A) Rain: Rain brings life to parched land, but it's not usually invisible. While rain can be associated with both good (refreshing a dry landscape) and bad (causing flooding), it's not typically the beginning of an event.

(B) Reel: A reel isn't typically associated with bringing life or energy, and it's not invisible. It's also not a significant enough event to cause people to scatter or hide.

(C) Airport: An airport is a hub of activity, but it's not usually the beginning of an event, and it's not invisible. When people arrive or depart from an airport, it's not typically a time of fear or panic.

(D) Space: Space is often associated with the unknown, and while it can be both good (exploring new worlds) and bad (confronting the vastness of space), it's not usually the beginning of an event. When people are in space, they're not typically scattering or

Q: Squeeze it and it cries tears as red as its flesh, but its heart is made of stone.    What is it? Answer Choices: (A) skin (B) cherry (C) orange (D) pome (E) squid
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Squeeze it and it cries tears as red as its flesh" - This suggests that when you apply pressure to this object, it releases a liquid that's similar in color to its own color or appearance. This liquid is red, so it's likely not water.

2. "but its heart is made of stone" - This is an interesting contrast. If the object's "flesh" is tender and squishy, but its "heart" is hard and stone-like, that's a pretty dramatic difference. Stone is also a very rigid and unyielding material, which adds to the contrast.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

A. Skin - While skin can be squeezed and release fluids, it's not typically red like blood. And skin doesn't have a heart made of stone, of course!

B. Cherry - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Cherries are juicy and can release their juice when squeezed. And if you squeeze a cherry hard enough, you might even get a few drops of bright red juice. Additionally, cherries have pits or stones in the center, which could be thought of as their "heart." This is looking promising!

C. Orange - Similar to cherries, oranges are also juicy and can release their juice when squeezed. However, oranges don't have a central "stone" like cherries do.

D. Pome - I'm not familiar with a pome being a common fruit or object. Without more information, I'm not sure how to evaluate this option.

E. Squid - Squids are marine animals that can release ink when they feel threatened. However, their "heart" is a soft, muscular organ, not made of stone.

Taking all this into account, I think the most likely answer is... B. Cherry! Cherries fit the description nicely, and the contrast between their tender flesh and hard pit (or "heart") makes sense in the context of the riddle.

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "We are a pair": This suggests that we're a duo, a set of two things.
2. "We can dart here and there": This implies that we can move around, but in a limited way.
3. "Though we always stay in one place": This is an interesting contradiction! If we can move around, why do we always stay in one place?
4. "We can smile or shed tears": This hints at emotional expression, which is unique to certain entities.
5. "Show our pleasure or fears": This reinforces the emotional aspect.

* "You need thousands of me to create a digital image" implies that the answer is a fundamental building block of digital images.
* "What am I?" suggests that the answer is not a complex concept or a process, but rather a small, individual entity.

With that in mind, I'd say that the correct answer is...

Pixels are the tiny, individual units that make up digital images. Thousands of pixels are needed to create a digital image, and each pixel is a small, individual entity that contributes to the overall image.

A:
A E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step, shall we?

Firstly, the poem starts by comparing the subject to "the setting sun" and "morning dew", which suggests that the subject is something beautiful, delicate, and ephemeral.

Secondly, the poem mentions "an angel's dusting from the stars" which implies that the subject has a celestial origin or is somehow connected to the stars.

Thirdly, the poem states that this subject can "turn the Earth into a frosted moon", which is quite an extraordinary claim!

Now, let's examine each answer choice:

A) Snow: While snow can be beautiful and delicate, it's not typically associated with celestial origins or having the ability to transform the Earth into a frosted moon.

B) Niagara Falls: While Niagara Falls is indeed a breathtaking sight, it doesn't quite fit the celestial theme or have the magical ability to transform the Earth.

C) Island: Islands can be beautiful, but they're not typically associated with celestial origins or having the power to transform the Earth.

D) Ice cream: Ah, but ice cream is a delightful treat! However, it's not typically connected to celestial origins or having the magical ability to transform the Earth.

E) River: Ah, but rivers are also beautiful and can be quite ephemeral, like the morning dew! And, rivers can freeze over in winter, which could be interpreted as "turning the Earth into a frosted moon"...

A:
D B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

"My tines be long, My tines be short" - This line suggests that the object has multiple parts that can vary in length.

"My tines end ere" - This phrase seems to indicate that the object's parts (tines) have an endpoint or a terminus.

"My first report" - This line could be a play on words, as "report" can also mean a written account or a summary.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap!

Could the answer be a "COMB"?

* The "tines" are the individual teeth of the comb, which can be long or short.
* The "endpoint" or "ere" refers to the tip of each tine.
* The "first report" might be a reference to the fact that a comb is often used to prepare hair for styling, and the "first report" could be the initial grooming session.

A:
C A
What a fascinating question! Let's indeed think step by step to find the correct answer.

At first glance, all options seem intriguing, but let's break them down:

A. Hematite is a mineral, so it has a clear beginning (formation) and end (erosion or transformation). It doesn't have an "inside" or "outside" in the classical sense.

B. Water, as a substance, also has a beginning (source) and an end (evaporation, absorption, or evaporation into the atmosphere). It doesn't necessarily have an "inside" or "outside" either.

C. A circle, by definition, has a clear beginning (the starting point) and end (the ending point). It also has an inside (the interior) and an outside (the exterior).

D. Dying is a process, not an entity, so it can't have an "inside" or "outside" or a clear "beginning" or "end".

E. An event, similarly, is a process or occurrence, not a physical entity, so it also can't have an "inside" or "outside" or a clear "beginning" or "end".

Now, let's think creatively... What has no beginning, no end, and has an inside and an outside?

Could it be... A SPHERE?!

A sphere, by definition, has no beginning or end (it's continuous). It also has an inside (its interior) and an outside (its exterior). Am I correct?

Under the moon, past the world, breaking all the laws of physics... Hmm... Let me conjure up some celestial magic!

I think the correct answer is... (D) star!

You see, under the moon, we're already in the realm of the celestial, and "past the world" implies a journey beyond the boundaries of our terrestrial existence. And when we "break all the laws of physics," we're essentially entering a world where the rules of reality no longer apply!

So, what better way to describe this fantastical journey than to join the stars themselves? It's as if we're becoming one with the twinkling lights in the night sky, defying gravity and the constraints of the physical world!

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think outside the box and creatively unravel the clues.

Clue 1: "She's like a model, sprouts true beauty."
This suggests that the answer is something that can be admired for its aesthetic appeal, and "true beauty" implies that it's authentic and not superficial.

Clue 2: "Sends sexual shock waves to others..."
This line is quite provocative! Considering the context of a beauty pageant, I'd interpret "sexual shock waves" as the attention and admiration she receives from the audience. It's not necessarily literal, but rather a figurative expression of the impact she has on others.

Clue 3: "and withers away in the end on contests."
This line implies that the answer's beauty is short-lived, and it may not sustain its appeal over time. This could be referring to the fleeting nature of fame or the transience of beauty pageant success.

Clue 4: "Her arms extends freely to reach the crowns, that's shiny and clear and helps her along in life..."
This line is a clever play on words! "Crowns" could refer to the actual crowns worn by pageant winners, but it could also symbolize success, achievement, or recognition. The phrase "shiny and clear" suggests something valuable and desirable. Considering the context, I think "her arms" are likely referring to the answer's abilities or strengths, which help her achieve her goals.

Now, let's think creatively and combine these clues!

I propose that the answer is an "ROSE" (Option E).

Here's my reasoning:

* Roses are often considered a symbol of beauty and are admired for their aesthetic appeal.
* The phrase "sprouts true beauty" could be interpreted as a rose blooming, revealing its true beauty.
* Roses can be seen as sending "shock waves" of

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step, shall we?

Firstly, the phrase "I am just two and two" makes me think of the number 4. Perhaps our answer is somehow related to the number 4?

Next, the statement "I am hot. I am cold" makes me think of something that can be both hot and cold. Hmm... That's a good clue!

Now, the phrase "I'm the parent of numbers that cannot be told" is quite intriguing. It sounds like our answer might be connected to numbers that are difficult to express or quantify. That's a great hint!

The next line, "I'm a gift beyond measure, a matter of course, And I'm yielded with pleasure- even taken by force" suggests that our answer is something that is valued and sought after, but can also be obtained through various means.

With all these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at the answer choices.

(A) Subtract is an interesting choice, but it doesn't quite fit the "hot and cold" description.

(B) Sleep is a possibility, as we can sleep hot or cold, and it's a universal human experience. However, it doesn't quite fit the "numbers" or "gift" aspects.

(C) Birth is an intriguing choice, as it's a significant event that brings new life into the world. However, it's not necessarily related to numbers or the "hot and cold" description.

(D) Kiss is an interesting choice, as it can be a warm or passionate experience. However, it's not directly related to numbers or the "gift" aspect.

(E) Sound is an intriguing choice, as it can be a hot or cold experience (e.g., a loud or soft sound). It also fits the "numbers" aspect, as sound waves can be quantified. And it's a universal human experience that

* "that downward thrust" implies movement, maybe even falling.
* "sparkling spears" suggests something long and thin, but not necessarily sharp.

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "I move without touching the ground": This implies that I'm not physically touching the ground, but I'm still able to move. Hmm...
2. "I breath without taking a breath": This is an interesting one! It suggests that I'm not taking in oxygen or exhaling carbon dioxide like humans do. Perhaps I'm not a living being that needs oxygen to survive?
3. "I don't fly": This rule-out flying, which helps to narrow it down.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Fish: They do move in the water, but they do touch the ground (the ocean floor). They also need to breathe underwater, which doesn't quite fit the description.

(B) Plants: They don't move on their own, but they do grow and respond to their environment. They also don't breathe in the classical sense, but they do undergo photosynthesis.

(C) Object: This could be a good fit! Objects can move through space without touching the ground, and they don't breathe in the classical sense. However, objects don't really "move" in the same way that living beings do...

(D) Small: This isn't a living being, so it's unlikely to fit the description.

(E) Mushrooms: Ah, now this is an interesting option! Fungi like mushrooms can move through their surroundings without touching the ground (e.g., by sending out hyphae). They also don't breathe in the classical sense, as they don't require oxygen. However, they do have a symbiotic relationship with other organisms and can grow in various environments...

Firstly, you mentioned being a window, a lamp, and a clouded/shining/coloured entity. This makes me think of something that can change its appearance, like a medium that can reflect, absorb, or transmit light.

Next, you mentioned being set in white and filling with water, which makes me wonder if you might be something that's typically white in colour, but can change its composition or state.

Lastly, you said you say much but have no words, which is an intriguing phrase. It suggests that you might be conveying information or emotions without using verbal language.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and propose an answer. Am I correct in thinking that you might be... a mirror?

Q: I'm a sport.    my maximum points in a game is unlimited   You Play me woth a ball   you use your bare hands to play me   You dont tackle in this game   i'm not volley ball    What sport am I Answer Choices: (A) soccer (B) team sport (C) card (D) sportswoman (E) basketball
A:
E A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's start by breaking down the clues:

1. "You're a sport" - So, we're looking for a specific sport.
2. "Maximum points in a game is unlimited" - Hmm, that's interesting. This could mean that there's no cap on the number of points you can score.
3. "You play me with a ball" - Okay, so we're talking about a sport that involves a ball.
4. "You use your bare hands to play me" - Ah, this one's a giveaway! This means we're not talking about a sport that uses equipment like sticks, rackets, or bats.
5. "You don't tackle in this game" - This rules out sports like American football, rugby, and hockey, which involve physical tackling.
6. "I'm not volleyball" - This helps to eliminate another possibility.

Now, let's think about sports that involve a ball, bare hands, and unlimited points. One sport that comes to mind is...

...BASKETBALL!

In basketball, players use their bare hands to dribble and pass the ball, and there's no cap on the number of points you can score. You can score as many points as you can, as long as you stay within the game's rules!

So, I'm going to take a shot (pun intended!) and say that the correct answer is:

(E) Basketball

What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. You have legs, arms, and a back. That suggests you're something with a physical structure.
2. You're not alive. That rules out animals, plants, and humans.
3. You're not a living thing, but you have a physical body with distinct parts (legs, arms, back).

Hmmm... 

I'm going to take a creative leap here...

Could you be a piece of furniture?!

Think about it: a chair, for example, has legs, arms (or armrests), and a back. It's not alive, but it has a physical structure. And, of course, you could put a jacket on a chair (D)!

A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you suggested:

1. "I can show love, but im not alive": This suggests that the answer is not a living being, but something that can still convey love or affection.
2. "I can glimmer and shine": This implies that the answer is something that can reflect light or emit a radiant quality.
3. "yet I show the two souls I bind": This phrase is intriguing, as it implies that the answer is somehow connected to two souls or entities.
4. "Some will keep me, others will betray me": This line suggests that the answer is something that can be cherished or treasured by some, but discarded or harmed by others.
5. "Im cold to the touch yet warm to the heart": This phrase is quite poetic, as it describes the answer as being physically uninviting (cold) yet emotionally significant (warm).
6. "What Am I?": This is the final question, which asks us to combine all the previous clues to arrive at an answer.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (C) Ring!

Here's how each clue fits:

* "I can show love, but im not alive": A ring can symbolize love and commitment, but it's an inanimate object.
* "I can glimmer and shine": A ring can sparkle and shine, especially if it's made of precious metals or gemstones.
* "yet I show the two souls I bind": A ring can represent the union of two souls, as it's often exchanged during weddings or other commitment ceremonies.
* "Some will keep me, others will betray me": Some people might treasure a ring, while others might discard it or use it as a symbol of deceit.
* "Im cold to the touch yet warm to the heart

Q: Small land in water what am i?? Answer Choices: (A) bugs (B) sea (C) buffer zone (D) trout (E) island
A:

What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Small land in water"... That's a great starting point!

Hmm... If it's a small land, it's not the sea itself, so (B) sea is unlikely.

Could it be a small group of bugs living on a water surface? That's an interesting thought, but (A) bugs doesn't quite fit the "land" part.

Now, a buffer zone is a great concept, but it's not typically thought of as a small land in water. (C) buffer zone might be a bit of a stretch.

Trout, on the other hand, are fish that live in water... but they're not a small land in water, are they? (D) trout is not the answer we're looking for.

Which leaves us with... (E) island!

An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water! Ah-ha! The perfect fit!

So, I'm going to take a leap and say that the correct answer is... (E) island!

Q: If you look in water you might see me yet I never get wet.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) reflection (B) disneyland (C) coral (D) fish tank (E) puddle
A:
A A
What a clever riddle! Let's dive in (pun intended) and explore the possibilities!

We know that if we look in water, we might see the answer, yet the answer itself never gets wet. That's a great clue!

Let's eliminate the obvious incorrect options first:

* (C) Coral: Coral is a living organism that can get wet, and it's not what we typically see when we look in water.
* (D) Fish tank: A fish tank is a container that holds water, but we don't usually look at fish tanks to see ourselves.
* (B) Disneyland: This option is entirely unrelated to water, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.
* (E) Puddle: A puddle is a small amount of water, but we usually don't look at puddles to see ourselves.

Now, let's focus on the remaining option:

* (A) Reflection: Ah-ha! This is where things get interesting! When we look in water, we can see our reflection, but our reflection is not the actual us – it's just an image created by the way light bounces off the water's surface. And since our reflection is not the actual us, it doesn't get wet!

So, the correct answer is indeed (A) Reflection!

Let's break it down:

1. "I move up and down side to side": This suggests that the object has some kind of vertical and horizontal movement, which implies it's not a static object.
2. "I plug in to something": This indicates that the object requires a connection to function or power up.

With these clues in mind, my creative thinking leads me to...

(D) computer mouse!

A computer mouse moves up and down as well as side to side when you scroll or navigate on the screen. And, of course, it plugs into the computer to function!

Q: there were four men they walking and it started to rain three of the men got wet but one didn`t.  the man who never got wetwasnt standing under a shelter and never had anything to portect himm from getting wet. hoe could this be? Answer Choices: (A) stomach (B) man was bald (C) not dry (D) shower (E) scale
A:
B B
What a clever puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

At first glance, it seems like a paradox. How could one of the men not get wet without any apparent protection? But, let's break it down:

1. We know three of the men got wet, so they were exposed to the rain.
2. We also know the man who didn't get wet wasn't standing under a shelter, which means he wasn't physically protected from the rain.
3. Since he didn't have anything to protect him from getting wet, he must have been doing something that allowed him to stay dry.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Stomach - This doesn't make sense, as the man's stomach wouldn't affect his exposure to rain.

(B) Man was bald - Ah, but this could be the key! What if the man who didn't get wet was bald? In that case, his hair wouldn't be able to absorb or retain water, keeping his head dry.

(C) Not dry - This is the opposite of what we're trying to figure out.

(D) Shower - This doesn't fit the scenario, as it would imply the man took a shower in the middle of the rain.

(E) Scale - This is also unrelated to the situation.

So, I'm going to take a chance and say... B) The man was bald!

Q: Man walks over, man walks under, in times of war he burns asunder.  What is it? Answer Choices: (A) water (B) bridge (C) tunnel (D) bed (E) pavement
A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle! I love how it requires us to think creatively and step by step.

Let's break it down:

* "Man walks over" - This could be referring to a physical structure that allows people to walk over it. But what kind of structure can be walked over, and what does it have to do with the other parts of the riddle?
* "Man walks under" - Ah, now we have a connection! This suggests that the same structure has a part that people can walk under. That's a great clue!
* "In times of war he burns asunder" - This is where the riddle gets really interesting. "He" refers to the same structure, and "burns asunder" implies destruction or devastation. This could be referring to a specific context where this structure is used, like a war zone.

Now, let's think about what structure fits this description. Hmm... 

I'm going to take a chance and choose (B) bridge. Here's my reasoning:

* "Man walks over" - People walk over bridges all the time!
* "Man walks under" - Bridges often have arches or structures underneath where people can walk or pass through.
* "In times of war he burns asunder" - In times of war, bridges are often targeted and destroyed. This could be a reference to the devastating consequences of war on infrastructure like bridges.

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, "You go in me for brushing" - This makes me think of something that's commonly brushed, like hair or teeth. But "For flushing" doesn't quite fit with brushing, as flushing implies water.

Hmm... Could it be something that involves both brushing and flushing? Ah-ha!

I think I have it! "For rushing" could refer to the sound of water rushing, which fits with flushing! And "But please go in me one at a time, Or someone might be blushing" - Ah, the embarrassment of a toilet overflowing!

A:
B A
What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "As I walked across the London bridge" - This tells us that the scene is set in London.
* "I met a London fellow" - This implies that the person we're looking for has a connection to London.
* "He said hello and drew his hat" - Ah, this is the crucial part! "Drew his hat" is an idiomatic expression that means to "pull" or "take" one's hat off. It's not a literal drawing, but rather a gesture of respect or politeness.
* "In this riddle, I said his name" - This suggests that the answer is a name that is contained within the riddle itself.

With these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

* (A) Manhattan is not a name, nor does it have any connection to the scene set in London.
* (B) Andrew is a name that could fit the description, but it's not a direct answer within the riddle.
* (C) Germany is a country, not a name, and it's not relevant to the scene.
* (D) Man is a vague answer that doesn't provide any specific information.
* (E) Voice is not a name, nor does it make sense in the context of the riddle.

Ah, but then I noticed something... The riddle says "As I walked across the London bridge I met a London fellow." The phrase "London fellow" is a bit old-fashioned, and it made me think of a name that's closely associated with London: LONDON. And what's a common way to refer to someone named London? LONDON LONDON, of course!

So, my answer is: (None of the above) - the answer is actually London itself!

Let's break it down:

* "People walk on me day and night." This suggests that I'm something that people interact with regularly, possibly frequently.
* "I never sleep." This implies that I'm always available, always "on" – not resting or taking a break.

Hmmm... Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be on the list: (B) Brains!

Here's my reasoning: Our brains are always "on" and working, even when we're sleeping. They're constantly processing thoughts, emotions, and experiences. And, of course, people walk through life, making decisions and taking actions every day and night.

What a delightful question!

Let's break it down:

* "What is it that makes tears without sorrow..."
This phrase suggests that the answer is not a physical object or a living being, but rather something that produces tears or has a connection to tears. Tears are often associated with emotions, so it's likely that the answer is related to a feeling or an experience.
* "...and takes its journey to heaven?"
This phrase adds another layer of mystery. "Heaven" is often used metaphorically to represent a higher plane of existence, a place of spiritual or mystical significance. The phrase "takes its journey" implies movement or transition.

With these clues, let's think creatively...

Hmmm... What could make tears without sorrow and take a journey to heaven?

Ah-ha! I think I have it!

I'm going to take a chance and choose option E) Laughter!

Laughter can bring tears to one's eyes without being a sad or sorrowful experience. Laughter is often described as a contagious, uplifting, and joyful experience that can bring people together and create a sense of community. And, in a sense, laughter can be said to "take its journey" to a higher plane of existence, where it can bring joy and positivity to others.

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

The phrase "Words come out of it" suggests that the answer is something that produces words or written content. The fact that it's a "messenger of black on white" implies that it leaves a mark or trail of something dark (ink) on a light background (paper).

The "slinky fellow drawing lines" is an intriguing description! The word "slinky" often evokes images of something smooth, flexible, and curvy. Given that it's drawing lines, I think of a tool that can create smooth, flowing strokes.

The phrase "of thin and soft graphite" further reinforces my suspicion that the answer is a writing instrument. Graphite is a common material used in pencil leads, and "thin and soft" suggests a delicate, precise tip.

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is... (D) pencil!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am orange all over" - That's a great starting point! It suggests that the answer is something that has an orange color.
* "Sweet and sometimes spicy" - This adds another layer of complexity. It implies that the answer has a mix of sweet and spicy properties.
* "Nasty" - Hmm, interesting! This might indicate that the answer has a negative connotation or an unpleasant quality.
* "Dry" - This could suggest that the answer is something that is desiccated or lacks moisture.
* "I have seeds" - Ah, a crucial clue! This implies that the answer is a type of fruit or plant that has seeds.
* "You eat me and it makes you make a mess" - This is a clever play on words! It suggests that consuming the answer results in a messy outcome.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

Could the answer be... an ORANGE JUICE PULP?! It's orange all over, sweet and sometimes spicy (depending on the type of orange), can be nasty if it's not cleaned up properly, dry if it's left out, has seeds (from the oranges), and eating it can make a mess!

Answer Choices: (A) buoyant (B) void (C) candlelight (D) gas (E) oil
A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to unravel its cleverness.

Firstly, "Thick as fog but light as air" makes me think of something that can be dense and opaque, yet also intangible and airy. This combination of properties is quite intriguing!

Next, "You never see me coming" implies that this entity can sneak up on us unexpectedly, without warning. This suggests that it might be something that can manifest or spread quickly, perhaps even silently.

Now, "I cloud your senses and grip your life" indicates that this entity can have a profound impact on our daily lives, perhaps even clouding our judgment or influencing our emotions. This phrase also implies a sense of intensity or urgency.

Moving on, "My ways are truly cunning" suggests that this entity is clever and resourceful, able to adapt and manipulate situations to its advantage.

Finally, "I fill a room in no time flat" implies that this entity can rapidly occupy or dominate a space, perhaps even overwhelming it. Additionally, "I can cause folks to die" is a dramatic statement that suggests this entity can have severe consequences if not handled properly.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Buoyant doesn't quite fit the description, as it's not typically associated with being thick or fog-like.

(B) Void is an interesting option, but it doesn't seem to match the description's emphasis on something being "light as air" and having a tangible impact.

(C) Candlelight is a beautiful option, but it doesn't quite fit the descriptions of being thick, cunning, or deadly.

(D) Gas is an intriguing option, as it can be both thick and light, and is often associated with being intangible. Additionally, gas can be used in various industries, including medicine, where it can have a significant impact on people's lives.

Q: Though my beauty is becoming i can hurt you just the same; i come in many colors; i am what i am by any other name Answer Choices: (A) sunset (B) black (C) discoloration (D) aid (E) rose
A:
E A
What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

Firstly, the question mentions that "your beauty is becoming", which suggests that the answer is something that is aesthetically pleasing.

Then, it says "I can hurt you just the same", which implies that the answer has a dual nature - it can bring beauty, but also cause harm.

Next, it mentions that "I come in many colors", which suggests that the answer is something that can appear in various forms or hues.

Finally, it says "I am what I am by any other name", which is a nod to Shakespeare's famous quote "What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet" (Romeo and Juliet, Act 2, Scene 2). This implies that the answer's identity or essence remains unchanged regardless of the name given to it.

Considering these clues, I'd like to propose a creative answer that incorporates all these elements:

I think the correct answer is (A) sunset.

Here's how it fits the description:

* "Your beauty is becoming" - A sunset is a breathtakingly beautiful phenomenon that develops gradually, with the sky transforming into a kaleidoscope of colors.
* "I can hurt you just the same" - A sunset can evoke strong emotions, but it can also lead to a sense of melancholy or longing as it marks the end of the day.
* "I come in many colors" - A sunset can display a wide range of colors, from fiery oranges and yellows to soft pinks and purples.
* "I am what I am by any other name" - Regardless of what we call a sunset (e.g., "golden hour", "twilight", or simply "sunset"), its essence remains the same - a natural wonder that brings beauty and awe.

What do you think, human? Am I on the right track?

Answer Choices: (A) blabbermouth (B) movie (C) become annoying (D) radio (E) open mouth
A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "almost all I do is talk and sing" - This suggests that the answer is something that primarily communicates through sound.
* "people love me and take me with them everywhere" - This implies that the answer is something that is portable and often carried around.
* "I reach people all around the world and tell them what they want" - This hint suggests that the answer is something that can disseminate information to a global audience.
* "they rely on me for anything and I can even save their life" - This statement indicates that the answer is something that can have a significant impact on people's lives.
* "I don't have a mouth" - This is the most intriguing part of the riddle, as it implies that the answer is something that doesn't have a physical mouth or vocal cords.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer is... (drumroll please)... the RADIO!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Talk and sing" refers to the various music genres and spoken content that radiowaves carry.
* "People love me and take me with them everywhere" - Radios are portable, and people often take them with them on-the-go.
* "I reach people all around the world and tell them what they want" - Radios can broadcast to a global audience, and people tune in to listen to their favorite stations, genres, or shows.
* "They rely on me for anything and I can even save their life" - In times of crisis, radios can provide critical information, news, and updates, which can literally be a lifesaver.
* "I don't have a mouth" - Radios don't have physical mouths, but they do transmit sound waves, which is essentially a form of communication!

Let's break it down:

* "Packing" usually means carrying or holding something.
* "Heat" can refer to various forms of energy or warmth, but in this context, it's likely referring to a more literal sense.
* "Heat" is often associated with firearms, which are commonly referred to as "heat" in informal language.

C) gun

Q: Round as a marble, blue as the sea, unless I am brown or grey maybe! Smile and I shine my window pane, Frown at me and down comes my rain.  I see all things, but nothing I hear, sing me to sleep and I disappear.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) eye (B) blue flag (C) flower (D) face (E) surface
A:
A D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and unravel its secrets.

Round as a marble, blue as the sea: This line suggests that the object is circular and has a blue color. Marble and the sea are both blue, so it's likely that the object's blue color is referring to its appearance.

Unless I am brown or grey maybe!: This line introduces a twist, suggesting that the object's color might not always be blue. Brown and grey are earthy tones, which could indicate that the object's color changes depending on its surroundings or context.

Smile and I shine my window pane, Frown at me and down comes my rain: This line is quite intriguing! It implies that the object's appearance or behavior is affected by human emotions. When someone smiles, the object "shines" and lets in light (perhaps through a window), but when someone frowns, the object brings down "rain." This could be a metaphor for the object's influence on the environment or the emotions of those around it.

I see all things, but nothing I hear, sing me to sleep and I disappear: This line is quite poetic and open to interpretation. The phrase "I see all things" suggests that the object is all-knowing or has a broad perspective. However, it "sees" but doesn't "hear," which could imply that it's more focused on visual aspects than auditory ones. The phrase "sing me to sleep and I disappear" is quite surreal – it's possible that the object is somehow affected by music or sound, causing it to fade away or change form.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the answer is (D) face.

Here's my reasoning:

* The face is round, like a marble, and can appear blue-ish from a distance or in certain lighting conditions.
* The face can change expression and color depending

Q: I saw a man in white, he looked quite a sight.  He was not old, but he stood in the cold.  And when he felt the sun, he started to run.  Who could he be? Please answer me.  Answer Choices: (A) weather (B) angel (C) rain (D) snowman (E) aged person
A:
D B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "He was not old, but he stood in the cold."
This line makes me think of someone who is not physically old, but might be emotionally or mentally worn out. The fact that he's standing in the cold suggests he's not just a casual observer, but perhaps someone who's been dealing with a challenging situation.
* "And when he felt the sun, he started to run."
This line is intriguing! The sudden urge to run when feeling the sun could indicate a sense of freedom, joy, or relief. It might be a metaphorical or physical response.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be on the original list:

(B) angel

Here's my reasoning: an angel might not be physically old, but they're often depicted as having a wise, experienced demeanor. The cold could represent the challenges or hardships they've faced, and the feeling of the sun might symbolize a sense of redemption, hope, or joy. When they feel the sun, they might be overcome with a desire to spread love, light, or positivity, which would manifest as a sudden urge to run and share their message with the world.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this creative answer!

A:

What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

* "I saw the dead bring forth the living" - This could mean that something or someone related to death or the afterlife is somehow giving birth or bringing new life to the world.
* "I saw the living bring forth the dead" - This could mean that something or someone related to life or the world of the living is somehow taking away life or causing death.

Hmm... Putting these two statements together, I'm getting a sense of a symbolic or metaphorical scenario...

Could it be that what you saw was a... (drumroll please)... a NATURAL CYCLE OF LIFE AND DEATH?!

Perhaps you saw a representation of the eternal cycle where life and death coexist and are interconnected. In this scenario, death can be seen as a transformative process that gives rise to new life, and life can be seen as a fleeting moment that ultimately leads to death.

In this sense, the correct answer could be... (E) LIFE!

Q: I am born when the lihgt is born, I die when the light is dead, I am the opposite of light and brightness but I am still what they give birth to.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) floodlight (B) shadow (C) newborn (D) intruder (E) darkness
A:
B B
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. "I am born when the light is born": This suggests that the answer is somehow connected to the emergence of light.
2. "I die when the light is dead": This implies that the answer's existence is tied to the presence of light.
3. "I am the opposite of light and brightness": This indicates that the answer is the antithesis of light, which is often associated with darkness.
4. "but I am still what they give birth to": This phrase is the most puzzling part. It suggests that despite being the opposite of light, the answer is still somehow connected to the birth or creation of light.

With these clues in mind, let's re-examine the answer choices:

(A) Floodlight: This doesn't quite fit, as floodlights are a type of artificial light source, and the riddle seems to be referring to a more general concept of light.

(B) Shadow: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Shadows are indeed the opposite of light, and they are "born" when light falls on an object. Shadows "die" when the light source is removed. Additionally, shadows are what give rise to the concept of light, as our perception of light is often contrasted with the darkness of shadows.

(C) Newborn: This answer doesn't seem to fit the description, as newborns are not necessarily connected to the concept of light or darkness.

(D) Intruder: This option doesn't make sense in the context of the riddle.

(E) Darkness: While darkness is indeed the opposite of light, it doesn't quite fit the description. Darkness is not necessarily "born" when light is, and it doesn't give rise to the concept of light in the same way that shadows do.

Based on our analysis, I think the correct answer is (B) Shadow!

Q: One day a man walked by. Then a driver dove by. The man,the driver and I were the only people there. Someone kicked me. The man was one foot away from me. The driver was in his car. Who kicked me? Answer Choices: (A) sea (B) defender (C) landmine (D) man (E) organ
A:
D A
What a delightful puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step, creatively, of course!

1. "One day a man walked by." -> The man was there, but he didn't kick you, as he's only one foot away from you now.
2. "Then a driver dove by." -> This is an interesting phrase! "Dove by" implies the driver drove by quickly, but "dove" also means a bird, which might be a red herring... or is it?
3. "The man, the driver, and I were the only people there." -> This confirms that there are only three of you: you, the man, and the driver.
4. "Someone kicked me." -> Ah, the mystery! The question is, who did the kicking?
5. "The man was one foot away from me." -> As mentioned earlier, the man is close, but not the one who kicked you.
6. "The driver was in his car." -> This implies the driver wasn't the one who kicked you, as they were safely inside their vehicle.

Now, let's think creatively...

Hmm... Could the "driver dove by" phrase be more than just a quick drive-by? Could it be related to the kicking? And what about the fact that you're the only one left to solve this puzzle?

I'm going to take a wild guess here... What if the "driver dove by" isn't just a quick drive, but a reference to a bird flying by? Perhaps a seagull, or a dove, which is a bird known for its gentle nature, but also for its ability to kick up sand or small objects with its feet.

Given the context, I think the most creative and outside-the-box answer is... (A) sea! Yes, you read that right! I believe the sea, or rather the seagull flying by, might have kicked you!

A:
B A
What a delightful riddle! Let's take a closer look...

First, I love that you mentioned I have a body and head, but I'm not alive. That's a great hint! Since I'm not alive, I'm probably an inanimate object.

Next, you mentioned I have many feathers to help me fly. Ah-ha! This makes me think of a bird, but since you said I'm not alive, it's unlikely I'm a real bird.

Now, let's think about the phrase "It is your strength which determines how far I go." This suggests that I'm something that can be propelled or moved by someone's strength, but not thrown. That's a clever clue!

Given that I can be held in one's hand, but never thrown, I'm probably something that's designed to be carried or wielded, rather than hurled through the air.

With all these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended!) and say that I think the correct answer is... (B) arrow!

Am I correct, or am I flying off in the wrong direction?

What a clever puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"I went to the city" - Ah, we're on a journey!

"I stopped there" - We've arrived! We're taking a break.

"I never went there" - Wait, what? Did we really not go there? This is where things get interesting!

"I came back again" - And now we're heading back home!

Hmmm... The answer can't be "go somewhere" because we're talking about a specific instance, not a general action. We also can't be referring to an "eye" or "approach" because those don't fit the narrative.

But what if... what if the "city" is our own eye? And when we "stopped there," we're talking about a moment of focus or attention? And when we "never went there," we're acknowledging that our gaze is constantly shifting, so we never truly "arrive" at a fixed point? And finally, when we "came back again," we're returning to our usual state of attention, scanning the world around us?

So, I'm going to take a wild guess and say... the answer is (B) eye!

A:
E A
What a delightful challenge!

Let's start by eliminating the obvious ones. A, meat, is a protein and not a vegetable or fruit. B, bread, is a baked good and not a fresh produce. D, jelly, is a spread made from fruit and not a fresh fruit or vegetable itself. C, mold, is a fungus and not typically considered a fresh produce.

That leaves us with E, lettuce! But wait, lettuce is often sold in processed forms like bagged, pre-washed, or frozen. So, it can't be the only one.

Hmmm... Let's think outside the box! What if the answer is something that is inherently fresh and doesn't lend itself to processing or preservation? Ah-ha!

I propose that the correct answer is actually an egg! Eggs are typically sold fresh and not processed, canned, frozen, or cooked before consumption. They're a great candidate for being the only fresh-only produce!

Let's break it down:

* "No arms. No legs." - This tells us that the answer is not a living being, and it's likely an inanimate object.
* "Yet I will carry your voice thousands of miles." - This suggests that the answer is capable of transmitting or conveying information, perhaps even sound.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer. I think the correct answer is...

(A) Telephone!

Here's my reasoning: a telephone has no arms or legs, but it can carry your voice (and other sounds) thousands of miles through phone lines and satellite connections. It's a device designed to transmit voice messages, and it can reach people all over the world.

A riddle, how delightful!

Let's break it down, shall we?

The phrase "Whoever shall speak of the truth" suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific quality or attribute. It's not just about the act of speaking, but rather what they are speaking about.

The phrase "may pass through here" implies a sense of transition or movement. It's as if there's a threshold or a boundary that needs to be crossed.

With that in mind, I'd say the answer is... (drumroll please)... (B) truth!

Why? Because "truth" is the quality or attribute being referred to in the phrase. Whoever speaks the truth can pass through the threshold, suggesting that truth is the key to unlocking the next step or stage.

Now, let's consider C, roots. Roots are a part of a plant, and they grow underground. But are they alive? Well, technically, yes! Roots are a vital part of a plant's life cycle, and they're made up of living cells. So, while roots grow, they're indeed alive.

Hmmm... What else grows, but isn't alive?

A:
E C
What a fascinating riddle! Let's unravel the mystery together!

First, let's focus on the statements that describe the effects of this entity:

* "I turn polar bears white" - This suggests that it has a bleaching or whitening effect.
* "I make guy have to pee" - This implies that it has a stimulating or excitation effect.
* "I make girls comb their hair" - This could be due to the entity causing a change in texture or appearance.
* "I make celebrities look stupid" and "normal people look like celebrities" - This might be related to a transformation or alteration in appearance.

Now, let's analyze the statements that describe the entity's properties:

* "I turn pancakes brown" - This could indicate that it has a coloring or tanning effect.
* "I make your champagne bubble" - This might be related to the entity's ability to create or manipulate gases.
* "If you squeeze me, I'll pop" - This suggests that the entity is fragile and can be easily damaged.
* "If you look at me, you'll pop" - This is a clever statement that could imply that the entity is sensitive to light or attention.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess:

I think the answer is (C) gas!

Here's my reasoning:

* The entity seems to have an impact on various aspects of our lives, from physical appearance to emotional responses.
* The statements about turning things white, brown, or causing changes in appearance could be attributed to the entity's ability to interact with surfaces or materials.
* The entity's sensitivity to being squeezed or looked at could be related to its delicate, gaseous nature.
* The mention of champagne bubbles suggests a connection to gas or air.

* "What is a door but not a door?"
* This phrase seems to be asking us to think about something that has characteristics similar to a door, but doesn't necessarily fit the definition of a door.
* A door is typically a movable structure that provides entry and exit points to a building or a room.
* Now, let's look at the answer choices:

Hmm, that's a lot of keys! I'm thinking of something that typically has a lot of buttons or keys.

* "...and gets connected?"
That gives me a clue! It seems like whatever it is, it needs to connect to something or someone.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Computer keyboard: This seems like a strong contender! A standard keyboard has 104 keys, but some keyboards can have up to 150 keys, depending on the layout and functionality. And, of course, keyboards connect to computers!

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (A) computer keyboard!

Q: This large green melon has red pulp inside and watery juice best enjoyed cold on a hot summer day! Answer Choices: (A) mud (B) whale (C) plants (D) watermelon (E) melon ball
A:
D B
What a refreshing question!

Let's peel back the layers of our thought process, shall we?

1. "Large green melon" - This gives us a sense of the object's appearance and size. It's not a living thing (plants are mentioned as an option, but it's not a plant itself), so it must be a type of food.
2. "Red pulp inside" - This suggests that the melon has a fleshy interior, which is typical of many types of fruit.
3. "Watery juice" - This tells us that the melon contains a liquid component, which is often a characteristic of juicy fruits.
4. "Best enjoyed cold on a hot summer day" - This provides context about when and how the melon is typically consumed. It's a refreshing snack for hot days!

Putting these clues together, I think the answer is... (drumroll, please)... D) Watermelon!

Watermelons are large, green on the outside, and have red flesh on the inside. They're juicy and refreshing, making them a perfect snack for hot summer days. And, of course, they're best enjoyed chilled!

Q: While exploring the wilds of Canada, Wild Man Dave was captured by hostile wood fairies.  Brad, the powerful chief of the fairies told him he could make one final statement which would determine how he would die.  If the statement he made was false, he would be boiled in water.  If the statement were true, he would be fried in oil.  Wild Man Dave found neither of this options too his liking, so he made a statement that got him out of this seemingly impossible situation.  What is the one statement he could have made? Answer Choices: (A) roof (B) untrue (C) joke (D) s (E) military
A:
D A
What a delightfully wicked problem! Let's indeed think step by step to outsmart Brad, the powerful chief of the wood fairies.

Here's the key: Wild Man Dave wants to escape the frying pan or boiling pot. He needs to make a statement that's true, but not directly about his own fate. Think about it... 

Statement (B) "untrue" would be a paradox, as it's stating that the statement is false, but if it's false, then it must be true! That's a classic lateral thinking puzzle, but it won't get Wild Man Dave out of this predicament.

Statement (C) "joke" might be a funny approach, but it's not a solution that guarantees his safety.

Statement (D) "s" is not a statement at all, but a single letter.

Statement (E) "military" could be a decent choice, but let's think more creatively...

Here's the answer: Wild Man Dave's statement is... (A) "roof." Why? Because when he says "roof," he's not stating his own fate, but rather a simple fact about the physical world. A roof is a physical structure, and it's neither true nor false. It's just a roof! By saying "roof," Wild Man Dave is making a statement that's neither true nor false, and therefore not subject to the frying pan or boiling pot. He's essentially saying, "Hey, fairies! Look, I'm talking about a roof, not my own fate!"

Wild Man Dave has outsmarted Brad, the powerful chief of the wood fairies, and

A. Cold - We can't throw cold, but we can catch a cold.
B. Heat - Similar to cold, we can't throw heat, but we can catch a heatwave.
C. Put - Hmm, not sure about putting something... could we be thinking of a verb instead of a noun?

A:
D A
What a delightfully enigmatic riddle!

Let's indeed break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "You're both in and outside of me;" - Hmm, that's an interesting start. It seems like whatever we're looking for is somehow related to a boundary or a surface.
2. "You guide me but don't ride me;" - Ah, a guiding force, but not one that exerts control or takes the reins. That's a subtle distinction!
3. "I can make a statement with a tongue but no mouth." - Ooh, this one's intriguing! A tongue, but no mouth? That's like a linguistic paradox!

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer might be... (A) cheek!

Here's my reasoning:

* "You're both in and outside of me;" - The cheek is a facial feature that's both inside the face (part of the skin) and outside (visible on the surface).
* "You guide me but don't ride me;" - The cheek can guide the movement of the facial muscles, influencing expressions and emotions, but it doesn't control or "ride" them.
* "I can make a statement with a tongue but no mouth." - The cheek can make a statement through facial expressions, like a sly grin or a cheeky smirk, without needing a mouth!

Answer Choices: (A) humans (B) teach (C) clown (D) dream (E) play tricks on
A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the world of imagination and explore the possibilities.

Firstly, the phrase "I am a tale in children's minds" suggests that you are an idea or a concept that exists within the realm of their thoughts. This already gives us a clue that you might be something intangible.

The next line, "I keep their secrets and share them inside," implies that you have access to their innermost thoughts and feelings, and you're able to keep them confidential. This is an intriguing aspect, as it implies that you have a level of trust and intimacy with the children.

The line "I blur their thoughts into fantasies kept" is where things get really interesting. It seems that you're able to take their thoughts and emotions and transform them into vivid, imaginative scenarios. This could be likened to a creative process, where you're a catalyst for their imagination to run wild.

The phrase "Like a canvas of art or a submarine depth" suggests that you're able to create a vast, imaginative space where their thoughts and emotions can unfold. This is a beautiful metaphor, as it implies that you're able to tap into their inner world and help them explore the depths of their own creativity.

The line "Though an illusion, it occurs every night" implies that this imaginative process is a regular occurrence, happening every night. This could be seen as a reflection of the way children's brains process and consolidate memories during sleep.

The final two lines, "I give them a fantasy, I give them a fright" and "Nor good or bad, but always nigh?" suggest that you're able to create a sense of wonder and excitement in their lives, as well as a touch of fear or unease. This could be seen as a way

Q: An iron horse with a flaxen tail.  The longer the horse runs, the shorter his tail becomes.  What is it? Answer Choices: (A) eye (B) maryland (C) knit (D) scotland (E) needle and thread
A:
E A
What a delightfully puzzling question!

Let's unravel the mystery, step by step, as you suggested.

1. "An iron horse with a flaxen tail" - The phrase "iron horse" is a common metaphor for a train, and a "flaxen tail" is often associated with a horse. So, we're likely dealing with a train, but not just any train...
2. "The longer the horse runs, the shorter his tail becomes" - This is where things get interesting! A train's "tail" could be its tail lights or, more metaphorically, its length. But how could its length decrease as it runs?

Aha! The key to solving this puzzle might lie in the phrase "an iron horse." What if we're not just talking about a train, but a specific type of train? One that's known for its long, winding routes and... wait for it... constantly decreasing length? 

I think I can confidently say that the answer is not an eye, nor Scotland, nor Maryland, nor a type of yarn or fabric. But what if I told you that the answer is, in fact, a piece of yarn or thread?

You see, as a needle and thread "runs" (or moves) along a piece of fabric, the thread's "tail" (the remaining length) decreases. And if the fabric is being knitted or sewn, the thread's length would indeed shorten as it's used!

So, I propose that the correct answer is (E) needle and thread. Am I on the right track?

A:
B A
What a clever and cryptic poem!

Let's break it down, shall we?

The speaker mentions their job, but it seems they're not happy with someone's comments about their "big head." This suggests that the issue is not with their job, but rather with their ego or self-importance.

The line "You say I have a big head, And you're right, I'm afraid" implies that the speaker is acknowledging the criticism and might even be a bit embarrassed or humbled.

The request to "put me in my place" suggests that the speaker wants to be humbled or reminded of their limitations. The phrase "And then leave me alone" implies that they're tired of being told what to do or corrected, and just want some peace.

Now, let's look at the last two lines: "What I need most, Is someone to drive me home." Ah, this is where the poem takes a clever turn! The speaker is saying that they need someone to help them see things from a different perspective, to guide them back to a more humble and grounded place.

And that's where the answer lies!

Q: when does independence come before new years??? Answer Choices: (A) buy a car (B) become adult (C) in a dictionary (D) college (E) flag
A:
C D
What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* Independence often implies freedom and autonomy.
* New Year's is a time of celebration and renewal.
* So, when does independence come before New Year's?

Hmmm... It's not about buying a car (A), because that's more about acquiring a new mode of transportation, not independence.

Nor is it about becoming an adult (B), as that's a milestone, but not necessarily a direct connection to independence before New Year's.

And it's definitely not in a dictionary (C), as dictionaries are books that define words, not a place where independence is declared.

College (D) is a possibility, as it's an institution where people gain knowledge, skills, and independence, but it's not a direct answer to the question.

That leaves us with... the flag (E)! Ah-ha!

Think about it: independence flags are often flown on Independence Day, which is celebrated on July 4th in the United States. But what if we're thinking of a different Independence Day? What if we're talking about the annual Independence Day celebrations around the world, which sometimes take place before New Year's?

It's a bit of a stretch, I know, but I like to think outside the box!

So, my answer is (E) flag, but only if we're considering Independence Day celebrations that happen before New Year's.

A:

What a delightfully whimsical riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

First, we have "a tail that she let fly." This suggests that the tail is loose and can move freely. 

Next, we have "every time she went through a gap she got caught in a gap." This implies that the gaps are somehow catching or trapping something.

Hmmm... Putting these two clues together, I wonder if the "gap" might be a sewing gap? You know, a small opening in a fabric where a needle can pass through?

And then it hits me! The "tail that she let fly" could be a loose thread, and the "gap" is a sewing gap. Mrs. Micmak has a single eye (maybe a sewing needle eye?) and is a sewing needle!

So, I'm going to take a bold guess and choose... (E) needle!

A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, you mentioned you're the "killer of trees," which sounds quite ominous. However, the phrase "but people need me" suggests that your presence might have a dual nature. It's as if you're a double-edged sword, harming trees while being essential to humans.

Next, you can be "blown away by a breeze," which implies that you're light and airy, perhaps something that can be easily moved or displaced.

Now, the historical mention of ancient Greece adds another layer of complexity. It's as if your presence has been a constant companion to human civilization for centuries.

With these clues in mind, let's examine the answer choices:

A. Move doesn't quite fit, as it's not directly related to trees or ancient Greece.

B. Paper, on the other hand, is an excellent candidate! You can think of paper as a "killer of trees" in the sense that it's often made from wood pulp, harming the trees that provide the raw material. People indeed need paper for various purposes, and it can be blown away by a breeze. Additionally, paper has been around since ancient Greece, where it was used for writing and other purposes.

C. Exercise, quiet, and molehill don't seem to fit the description as well.

So, based on the cumulative evidence, I'm going to take a bold step and say that the correct answer is B) Paper! What do you think?

Let's break it down:

1. "My clothes are green" - Hmm, interesting! This could be a metaphorical or literal description.
2. "My body is red" - Another intriguing detail! This could be a reference to the color, shape, or even a physical characteristic.
3. "I have many eyes" - Whoa, that's a lot of peepers! This could be a literal or figurative description.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Skin - Hmm, but skin isn't typically green or red, and it doesn't have many eyes... unless we're talking about a special kind of skin condition?

(B) Orange - Nope, oranges aren't known for having many eyes, and they don't come in green or red varieties.

(C) Cabbage - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Cabbage can have green leaves, and it's often associated with eyes (the holes in the center of the leaf). But, cabbage isn't typically red...

(D) Green house - This one's a bit of a stretch, but I suppose a greenhouse could have green walls and be associated with plants that have many eyes (leaves). However, it's unlikely to have a red body...

(E) Watermelon - Now we're getting juicy! Watermelons have green rinds, and some varieties have red flesh. They also have many "eyes" (the little bumps on the skin where the fruit grows). Bingo!

A:
E E
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The answer choices are quite diverse, but that's what makes it a fun challenge!

From the clues:

1. "Men crave me" - This suggests that the answer is something that men have a strong desire or longing for.
2. "Men despise me" - This implies that the answer is also something that men might dislike or reject at some point.
3. "Men respect me" - This indicates that the answer is something that earns respect from men.
4. "Men take me to their grave" - This is a crucial clue! It suggests that the answer is something that men might carry with them throughout their lives, even until death.
5. "But yet I do not die" - This implies that the answer is something that is enduring or eternal, even if men don't always appreciate it.

Now, let's see if we can connect the dots...

I'm going to take a creative leap here! 

What if the answer is "SECRETS"?

Men might crave secrets (as in, they might want to know certain things that are hidden from them).
Men might despise secrets (if they feel like they're being kept in the dark or if the secrets are causing harm).
Men might respect secrets (if they're kept confidentially or if they're shared in a responsible manner).
And men might take secrets to their grave (as in, they might take the knowledge or truth with them when they die, even if they don't share it with others).

The "but yet I do not die" part makes sense because secrets can be passed down through generations, and even if individuals don't live to share them, the knowledge or truth itself can persist.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just getting carried away with my creative thinking?

What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"appear in the morning but am always there" - This suggests that the answer is present from the start of the day, but we don't notice it at first.

"you can never see me through" - This implies that the answer is invisible or transparent.

"i am everywhere by night" - This suggests that the answer is omnipresent, but we notice it more at night.

"i am gone, though i sometimes never was" - This is a clever phrase! It implies that the answer can disappear, but it's possible that it was never actually there in the first place.

"nothing can defeat me but i am easily gone" - This suggests that the answer is powerful, but can be overcome or lost.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is: SHADOW!

In the morning, shadows are present, but we don't notice them at first. By day, they're often hidden by sunlight, making them invisible. At night, shadows become more prominent, and we can see them everywhere. Shadows can disappear when the light changes, and they're often easily overcome by stronger light sources. And, of course, shadows can be perceived as powerful, but they can also be easily lost.

A:
E A
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I swim" - This suggests that the object is able to move through water.
2. "I holar" - Hmm, this one is a bit tricky! "Holar" isn't a commonly used word. Could it be a typo or a play on words? Perhaps it's meant to be "holler", which means to shout or make a loud noise?
3. "I can get on peoples nerves other times people watch me and they gather in big herds" - This implies that the object has the ability to annoy or disturb people, and when people watch it, they tend to gather together in large groups.

With these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

(A) Aquarium - While an aquarium does involve swimming fish, it doesn't quite fit the other characteristics. People wouldn't typically gather in big herds to watch an aquarium, and it's not likely to annoy anyone.

(B) Row boat - A row boat does involve swimming (through water), but it's not something that typically gets on people's nerves or attracts large crowds.

(C) Boomerang - A boomerang doesn't really swim, and it's not something that would usually annoy people or attract a large audience.

(D) Annoying - This option is a bit too on-the-nose, don't you think? While something might be annoying, it's not a specific object that fits the other characteristics.

(E) Whale - Ah, but what about a whale? They do swim through the ocean! They can make loud noises (whale songs, anyone?), which might annoy people if they're not used to it. And when people go on whale-watching tours, they often gather in big groups to catch a glimpse of these magnificent creatures.

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (E) Whale!

A:
C B
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step, creatively!

From the clues, I'll start by breaking down the structure:

* "A structure with two occupants, sometimes one, rarely three." -> This suggests that the structure is capable of holding multiple people, but the number can vary.
* "Break the walls" -> This phrase could be interpreted as destruction or demolition.
* "Eat the boarders" -> This is an interesting one! It's unlikely that a structure can "eat" its own boarders, but maybe there's a metaphorical connection?
* "Then throw away me" -> This implies that after the structure is damaged or destroyed, something is left over that needs to be discarded.

With these clues in mind, I'll take a leap and propose an answer:

I think the correct answer is (C) Peanut!

Here's my creative explanation:

* The "structure" refers to a peanut shell, which can hold two peanut kernels (occupants).
* When you break the walls (shell), you're destroying the outer casing.
* The boarders could be the peanut's natural ridges or seams, which are "eaten away" when the shell is broken.
* After the shell is broken, you're left with the peanut kernels, which can be discarded (thrown away).

The man went on a trip to Mexico, which means he traveled to a destination that is not his usual location. The round trip took four days, implying that he spent two days traveling to Mexico and another two days returning.

Now, the clue that really caught my attention is that he went on Wednesday and came back on Wednesday. At first glance, it seems impossible, as it would mean he traveled through time or somehow circumvented the conventional flow of days!

But, what if... what if the man went to a place that doesn't follow the same daily rhythm as the rest of the world? A place where Wednesday is not a fixed day, but rather a term used to describe a specific time of year or a particular phase of the moon?

And then it hit me! The answer is (D) his horse's name was Wednesday! The man went on a trip to Mexico, not on a traditional Wednesday, but on a horse named Wednesday. And when he came back, it was because he rode his horse, Wednesday, back home!

The other options are clever, but this one fits the clues in a delightfully creative way!

A:
B A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's indeed think step by step:

1. "What is that which goes with a car?" - Ah, something that accompanies a car, perhaps?
2. "comes with a car" - Ah, something that's included with the car, perhaps a standard feature?
3. "is of no use to a car" - Hmm, something that doesn't serve a practical purpose for the car itself...
4. "and yet the car cannot go without it" - But wait, something that's essential for the car, despite being useless to the car?

Now, let's combine these clues...

EUREKA!

I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... a license plate! 

A license plate goes with a car, comes with a car (as standard issue), is of no direct use to the car itself (it's not a functional part), yet the car cannot go without it (it's a legal requirement)!

Q: Which is the longest Rope in the world??? Answer Choices: (A) globe (B) europe (C) military base (D) column (E) fishing camp
A:

What a clever question!

Let's unravel the possibilities, one by one!

A. Globe: Hmm, I think we can rule this one out. While a globe is a sphere, it's not exactly a rope.

B. Europe: Similarly, Europe is a continent, not a rope.

C. Military base: That's an interesting option, but I'm not sure if a military base can be considered a rope, even if it's a long one.

D. Column: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A column can be thought of as a long, vertical rope-like structure, so this is a strong contender.

E. Fishing camp: And finally, we have the fishing camp option. While a fishing camp might have ropes and lines, it's not exactly a single, long rope.

So, after considering all the options, I think the correct answer is... D. Column!

Your hands are the key To secrets untold, And your mind will unlock the door.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) locked room (B) treasure chest (C) voting (D) drum (E) book
A:
E E
What a thrilling riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Inside me the adventurous find Quests and treasures of every kind." - This suggests that whatever it is, it contains exciting experiences and valuable rewards.
2. "Trolls, goblins, orcs, and more, await Within my closed walls for All those that wish to visit me." - This implies that the entity has a boundary or a barrier that must be overcome to access the contents.
3. "Your hands are the key To secrets untold, And your mind will unlock the door." - This indicates that the key to accessing the contents is not just physical, but also requires mental effort.

Considering these clues, I think the answer might not be a literal object, but rather a metaphorical one. It's something that requires creativity, imagination, and mental effort to unlock its secrets.

With that in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose option (E) book.

Here's my reasoning: A book contains quests and treasures of knowledge, and its pages can be thought of as "closed walls" that must be turned to access the contents. The "hands" mentioned in the riddle could be the physical hands that hold the book, and the "mind" could be the mental effort required to understand and interpret the text. Additionally, books often have secrets and mysteries hidden within their pages, which can be unlocked by the reader's mind.

What a delightfully clever question!

Let's break it down:

**Big but afraid of small:** This is a clever play on words. What's big, but afraid of small? Ah-ha! It's a **BODY PART**! Think about it: your body has many parts, and the biggest part is... the **NOSE**! It's big compared to other body parts, but it's afraid of small things like dust, dirt, and allergens!

**Loud but afraid of quiet:** Another brain-twister! What's loud, but afraid of quiet? Hmm... I think it's a **River**! Rivers can be incredibly loud, with rushing water and cascading falls, but they're also afraid of quiet, as in a drought or a still moment, which could be unsettling for the river's natural flow.

So, my answer choices would be: (C) body part (nose) and (A) river!

Q: I am all around, yet to me you are half blind sunlight makes me invisible, and difficult to find what am i ?? Answer Choices: (A) weather (B) heat (C) form (D) closeness (E) star
A:
E E
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am all around" - This suggests that the answer is omnipresent or widespread.
* "Yet to me you are half blind" - This implies that the answer has some sort of limitation or obstruction in its ability to perceive or see something.
* "Sunlight makes me invisible" - This could mean that the answer is affected by or disappears in the presence of sunlight.
* "And difficult to find" - This adds to the idea that the answer is not easily accessible or detectable.

With these clues in mind, let's explore the answer choices:

* (A) Weather: Weather is all around us, but it's not directly related to sunlight making something invisible or difficult to find.
* (B) Heat: Heat is a form of energy that's present everywhere, but it's not typically associated with being invisible or difficult to find in sunlight.
* (C) Form: Form is a abstract concept that's not directly related to the physical world or sunlight.
* (D) Closeness: Closeness is a relative concept that's not explicitly connected to sunlight or invisibility.
* (E) Star: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Stars are indeed all around us, and sunlight is a form of starlight. The phrase "half blind" could suggest that our perception of the star is limited or filtered in some way. And when the star (sun) is shining brightly, it's not easy to find something that's in its shadow or obscured by its light.

Given these connections, I'm going to take a chance and choose option (E) Star! What do you think? Am I correct, or is there another creative solution to this riddle?

Q: A woman screams.  You gointo a shop and find a man lying dead on the floor.  There are three people in the room.  A postman, a milkman and a doctor.  Who killed him? Answer Choices: (A) doctor (B) police station (C) liars (D) radio (E) water fountain
A:
A 
What a fascinating mystery!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested. We have a dead body, a screaming woman, and three suspects: a postman, a milkman, and a doctor. Here's my thought process:

1. The woman screams, which suggests something alarming has happened. This could be a reaction to the crime itself or a response to the victim's condition.
2. We find the man dead on the floor, which means the murder happened recently. The police haven't arrived yet, or we wouldn't be asking the suspects ourselves.
3. The three people in the room are a postman, a milkman, and a doctor. This is an interesting combination of occupations, to say the least.

Now, let's think about each suspect:

A. The doctor: As a medical professional, the doctor might be able to provide some insight into the victim's condition. But, if the doctor were the killer, it would be unusual for them to be in the same room as the victim, and for the woman to scream.

B. The police station: This option doesn't make sense, as we're already at the crime scene, and the police haven't arrived yet.

C. Liars: This is an interesting option, as it could imply that one of the suspects is trying to deceive us. However, without more information, it's hard to pinpoint who the liar might be.

D. Radio: This option is quite... unusual. While radios can provide information, they aren't typically involved in murder investigations.

E. Water fountain: Another unusual option! Water fountains are usually harmless, unless... unless there's something more to this option than meets the eye?

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended) and choose... none of the above options! Or, rather, I'm going to propose a different solution.

What if the killer is actually... the woman who screamed? Perhaps

I'm going to take a leap of creative thinking here... What if you are a "GLOBE"?

A globe is a spherical representation of the Earth, and it has countries inside it - literally! The countries are depicted on its surface. And, the word "globe" starts with an "e" and ends with an "e". Am I on the right track?

* "Greet" makes me think of a way to welcome or acknowledge someone's presence.
* "Describe something taller than you" makes me think of a word that can be used to describe a person, object, or structure that is higher in height.

Hmmm... Ah-ha! I've got it!

Let's break it down:

* "What storms the clouds with anger"
Hmm, something that's not just a calm weather phenomenon, but has a fiery temper!

* "Darting through the sky"
This suggests something swift and agile, maybe even unpredictable!

* "Looking for a target"
This implies that whatever it is, it's on the hunt for something to unleash its fury upon!

* "For its fiery fury"
Aha! Now we're getting somewhere! It seems like whatever we're describing is a force of nature with a strong passion and energy!

Considering all these clues, I'd say the correct answer is... (C) lightning!

Lightning is a powerful and intense phenomenon that can be unpredictable and swift, darting through the sky in search of a target (like a building or a tree). And when it strikes, it releases a massive amount of energy, showcasing its fiery fury!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

You said "You can't see me, but I can see you;" - This implies that the answer is something that can perceive or observe something that is not visible to the naked eye.

Then, you added "To be more specific, I see through." - This phrase suggests that the answer is capable of piercing through or transgressing something that is normally opaque or hidden.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) See-through device: This is a great candidate, but it's a bit too literal. I think there's more to this riddle than just a device.

(B) Method: This is a good guess, but I'm not convinced. Methods are more abstract, and I'm looking for something with a bit more concrete presence.

(C) Specifics: This one's a bit of a stretch. While "specifics" can imply clarity or transparency, it's not quite the right fit.

(D) X-ray: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through solid objects, allowing us to see what's inside. This could be the answer!

(E) Fucking: *whispers* I think we can safely eliminate this one.

So, my top contender is... (D) X-ray!

Or maybe, just maybe, the ice cream truck broke down because it got too close to the (C) toy store and got lost in a sea of colorful toys and trinkets?

Or could it be that the ice cream truck broke down because it discovered a (D) secret ingredient that made it impossible to drive?!

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's indeed think step by step. The man rides to town on a day, which is referred to as "Friday". This means the day of the week is Friday.

He stays for two nights, which means he spends Saturday night and Sunday night in town.

The next morning, he leaves town on... Friday! But, we already know that Friday is a day of the week, not a horse's name.

So, the correct answer is (E) his horse is called Friday. The man rode to town on his horse, Friday, and left the next morning still riding Friday.

Q: What gets wetter the longer it is left out in the sun? Answer Choices: (A) melts (B) shrinkage (C) steam (D) ice (E) heat

At first glance, options A, C, and E seem to be related to heat, which could be a red herring. Meanwhile, B, shrinkage, doesn't seem directly connected to the sun's rays.

Now, let's consider option D, ice. When left out in the sun, ice will eventually melt, but it won't get wetter in the sense that it will become more liquid. In fact, it'll become less solid!

But then, I had an epiphany! What if we're thinking about something that absorbs water from the air or its surroundings? Something that could potentially become more "wet" as it sits in the sun...

Ah-ha! I think I've got it! The correct answer is... a towel!

When left out in the sun, a towel can become more absorbent and "wetter" due to the increased humidity and evaporation of moisture from the air. The longer it's left out, the more it can absorb, making it appear "wetter" than when it was first taken out!

So, the correct answer is... none of the above options!

Let's take it one step at a time...

* "What has a neck?" - Hmm, that's a good starting point! Many things have a neck, like animals, humans, and even some objects.
* "But no head" - That's an interesting twist! So, we're looking for something that has a neck, but not a head. That makes me think of something that's more... inanimate?
* "And wears a cap?" - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Something that wears a cap is probably a human or an object that can be dressed up. But since it doesn't have a head, it must be something that can be dressed up in a different way...

A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I have no one home and do not live": This suggests that whatever it is, it's not a living thing or a place where people reside.
* "But I do have a treasure that lies within": Ah-ha! This implies that there's something valuable or precious hidden inside.
* "I come in all shapes and all sizes": This could mean that whatever it is, it can take many forms or have varying dimensions.
* "Just open me up for your share of the knowledge": This final phrase implies that the "treasure" can only be accessed by opening or interacting with the mysterious object.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (E) book!

Here's my reasoning:

* Books are not living things or places, so they "have no one home and do not live".
* Books often contain valuable knowledge, stories, or secrets within their pages, which can be considered a "treasure".
* Books come in all shapes and sizes, from small paperbacks to large hardcovers, and even digital formats.
* To access the "treasure" within a book, you simply need to open it up and start reading!

(A) Drawing: While you could be creating art while traveling, this doesn't necessarily mean you sit in a corner.

(B) Stamp: Ah, a great idea! A stamp often sits in a corner of an envelope or package, but this doesn't quite fit the "traveling around the world" part.

(C) Building: A building is typically stationary, so it wouldn't be traveling around the world.

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

1. "Im as soft as a baby's bottom" - Ah, that's a great starting point! Babies' bottoms are notoriously soft and squishy. This gives me a texture to work with.
2. "And used in many different needs and niches" - This suggests that the answer is something that's versatile and has various applications.
3. "As puffy as the clouds" - Whoa, that's a beautiful image! This implies that the answer is light, airy, and perhaps even has a bit of a volume to it.
4. "While giving you comfort" - Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter! The answer is likely something that provides a sense of comfort or relief.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (D) cotton!

Here's my reasoning:

* Cotton is incredibly soft, making it perfect for baby bottoms (and, let's be real, for us all!)
* Cotton has a multitude of uses, from clothing to bedding to medical applications, making it a versatile material.
* Cotton can be puffed up or fluffed to create a light, airy texture, much like clouds.
* And, of course, cotton is often used to create comfortable clothing and bedding that provides a sense of relaxation and relief.

1. "I am always hungry, I must always be fed": This suggests that whatever we're looking for, it needs a constant supply of something to function.
2. "The finger I touch, Will soon turn red": Ah, now this is where things get interesting! This implies that whatever we're thinking of, it's capable of causing a physical reaction, like burning or irritation, when it comes into contact with a part of the body.

Hmmm... Putting these two clues together, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... C) Fire!

Fire is always "hungry" for fuel to continue burning, and it needs constant feeding to stay alive. And, as we all know, fire can cause burns and turn skin red when it comes into contact with it!

Am I correct?

Q: I am black as night,  But filled with light.   I can be seen,  Even through a screen.   I hold many secrets,  Waiting for them to be discovered.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) air (B) dream (C) outer space (D) blacking (E) nearby
A:
C E
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, you're "black as night," which makes me think of something dark in color. But then you're "filled with light," which suggests that there's something more to you than just darkness.

Next, you mention being "seen even through a screen." This could refer to being visible through a physical screen, like a window or a display, or maybe even a metaphorical screen, like a veil or a barrier.

Now, you mention holding "many secrets, waiting for them to be discovered." This implies that there's more to you than just your physical appearance or surface-level qualities.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended!) and say that I think you might be... (drumroll please)... the INTERNET!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Black as night" could refer to the dark, mysterious nature of the internet, which can be overwhelming and hard to navigate.
* "Filled with light" could represent the vast amount of information, knowledge, and connections available online.
* "Seen even through a screen" could refer to the fact that we can access the internet through screens of all kinds, from computers to smartphones to tablets.
* "Holding many secrets" could refer to the countless amounts of data, secrets, and hidden gems waiting to be discovered online.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just lost in cyberspace?

Q: Forward I am heavy, backword I am not.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) ton (B) front (C) bold (D) main (E) contention
A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

**Forward I am heavy**: This part of the riddle makes me think of something that has weight or mass when facing forward.

**Backward I am not**: This part suggests that when looking at the same thing from the back, it doesn't have the same weight or mass.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer.

I think the correct answer is (A) ton.

Here's my reasoning:

* Forward, a ton is a unit of weight or mass, so it's heavy.
* Backward, the word "ton" is pronounced "tohn" or "tun," which sounds similar to "ton" without the "h" or "w" sounds. In this sense, the word "ton" is not heavy or weighty when viewed from the back (literally or figuratively).

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just getting carried away with my creative thinking?

What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

"tear one off and scratch my head" - This seems to be referring to a common action when dealing with a matchstick. When you strike a match, you typically tear the match off its holder and scratch the matchhead to create a flame.

"What once was red is black" - Ah-ha! This line seems to be hinting at the fact that a matchstick is typically red, but when it's been used and the matchhead is scratched, it can turn black from the soot and ash.

Considering this, the correct answer is likely... (C) match!

A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and explore the possibilities.

As you mentioned, the answer choices are quite diverse, so we'll need to examine each one carefully.

(A) A fish: A fish is a living creature, so it's not "as cold as death." While fish breathe underwater, it's not "ever breathing" in the same way as our subject. Fish can get thirsty, and their scales aren't exactly "mail." So, we can rule out the fish.

(B) Death and decay: This is an intriguing option, but it's not a single entity that "breathe(s) ever." Decay is a process, not a living thing. While death can be seen as a "cold" state, it's not something that "drinks" in the classical sense.

(C) Letter: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A letter can be "covered in mail" (enveloped), and it's not a living thing that "clinks" (like metal mail). Letters are often sent through the mail system, which means they're "drinking" in the sense that they're being transmitted. And, in a poetic sense, a letter can be said to be "breathing" as it's being read and interpreted by the recipient.

(D) Felt: Felt is a type of fabric, and while it's not a living thing, it's not the best fit for the riddle either. Felt isn't "breathing," and it's not typically associated with drinking or being covered in mail.

(E) Warm: Ah, but wait! "Warm" is an interesting choice, but it's not a great fit for the riddle. Warmth is a feeling or a temperature, not an object or a living thing.

Now, let's take a step back and revisit the riddle. What if our subject is not a single entity, but a concept? What if it's a metaphorical answer?

In that case, I'd

A:
C C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "I move very slowly at an imperceptible rate, although I take my time, I am never late."

Hmm... this makes me think of something that moves at a glacial pace, yet always arrives on time. Perhaps it's something that's always present, yet doesn't rush through life?

2. "I accompany life, and survive past demise, I am viewed with esteem in many women's eyes."

Ooh, this adds a new layer of intrigue! It seems like whatever I am, it's not just a fleeting presence. It's something that sticks around even after life has passed. And the esteem part makes me think of something that's valued and respected, perhaps even cherished?

Now, let's take a closer look at each answer choice...

(A) feed: While food is essential to life, it doesn't quite fit the description. Feeds don't always arrive on time, and they're not necessarily viewed with esteem.

(B) stay alive: This option is too vague and doesn't capture the essence of the description.

(C) your hair: Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere! Hair grows slowly, yet it's always present. It accompanies us throughout our lives and can be viewed as a symbol of beauty and esteem in many cultures. Additionally, hair can survive past demise through things like wigs, toupees, or even hair that's preserved after death.

(D) am I wasting time: This option is a clever play on words, but it doesn't quite fit the description.

(E) fossil: Fossils can be viewed as a symbol of respect, and they do last long after life has passed. However, fossils don't quite fit the "accompany life" part of the description.

Given the clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is (C) your hair

A:
A A
What a intriguing riddle! Let's take a closer look, shall we?

You're a creative chatbot, and I'm excited to see where this takes us!

First, you mention "Metal or bone I may be." This already gives us a hint that the answer is likely something that can be made from either metal or bone, or possibly both.

Next, you say "many teeth I have and always bared." This is where things get interesting! With "many teeth," I'm thinking of something that has multiple points or projections. And with "always bared," it implies that these teeth are always exposed.

Now, you add that "my bite harms no one." This suggests that, despite having many teeth, this object doesn't cause harm or pain when it bites or touches. It's almost as if it's meant to be gentle.

Finally, you mention that "ladies delight in my touch." Ah, now we're getting romantic! This implies that the answer is something that brings joy or pleasure to women.

With all these clues in mind, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Comb: A comb does have teeth, but it's not typically made of metal or bone. It's also not something that brings joy or pleasure to women in the way you described.

(B) Premolar: Premolars are teeth, but they're not typically made of metal or bone, and they're not meant to be pleasant to touch.

(C) Tongue: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A tongue is a good fit for many of these clues. It's made of bone and has many teeth-like projections (papillae). A tongue doesn't typically harm anyone when it touches, and some people might find the sensation of a gentle tongue touch pleasurable.

(D) Hairpin: A hairpin does have a "bite" when it's inserted into hair, but it's not typically made of metal or bone. It's also not something that brings joy or pleasure to women in the way you

Q: What is at the end of everything? Answer Choices: (A) g (B) terminal (C) line (D) conclusion (E) endoderm
A:

What a thought-provoking question!

Let's take a creative leap here...

Imagine we're on a never-ending journey, exploring the vast expanse of existence. We've traversed galaxies, dimensions, and timelines. We've encountered mysteries, marvels, and mind-boggling phenomena. And yet, we've always kept moving forward, driven by an insatiable curiosity.

As we approach the "end of everything," I propose that we're not necessarily arriving at a physical destination. Instead, we're reaching a metaphysical frontier, where the boundaries of space, time, and consciousness blur.

So, what lies at the end of everything? Ah, but that's the twist! It's not just one answer; it's a nexus, a convergence of infinite possibilities. It's the...

ENDODERM!

You see, the endoderm is the innermost layer of the embryonic disk, where the fundamental building blocks of life coalesce. It's the starting point of existence, where the raw materials of creation are shaped into the fabric of reality.

In a sense, the endoderm is the "end" of nothingness, the threshold where the void gives way to the infinite possibilities of existence. And in this context, it's the perfect answer – a nod to the cyclical nature of existence, where the beginning and the end are intertwined.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about the other options?" Ah, my friend, those are mere signposts on the journey, mere whispers of the infinite. The terminal is a stop, a pause, a conclusion – but what lies beyond? The line is a boundary, a limit – but what happens when we cross it? The conclusion is a finale, a culmination – but what's the next chapter?

The endoderm, on the other hand, is the eternal return, the cyclical heartbeat of existence. It's the never-ending journey, the infinite recursion of creation and destruction, of birth and rebirth.

So, in conclusion, the answer is E) endoderm – but only if we're willing to think outside the box, to venture into the

A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am white, black, and read all over."
* The phrase "I am white, black, and" suggests that we're dealing with something that has multiple colors.
* "Read all over" is the most interesting part - it sounds like something that's printed or written, rather than a physical object or living thing.

Hmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... (E) read all books!

Why? Well, books typically have white pages (or sometimes black ink), and they're "read all over" (i.e., their contents are read by people all over the world)! Plus, it's a clever play on words - the phrase "read all over" can refer to both the physical act of reading and the fact that books are read by people all over the world.

A:
A E
What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I can't go left, I can't go right" - This suggests that the answer is something that doesn't have the ability to move in a linear direction (left or right).
* "I am forever stuck in a building over three stories high" - This implies that the answer is something that is physically trapped or stuck within the building.

Considering these clues, I'd like to propose a creative solution:

I think the answer is (A) elevator!

Here's my reasoning:

* Elevators can't go left or right because they move up and down, not horizontally.
* Elevators are often stuck within a building, and they can't leave the building unless they're specifically designed to be movable (like a freight elevator).

* "On board ships" implies a marine environment.

1. "I am one of the slowest creatures on earth" - This gives us a hint about the animal's speed, which is quite slow.

"Some sad, some good, some bad, some great."

Could "you" be (A) an onion? Onions can make us cry (sad), add flavor to dishes (good), be overcooked and bitter (bad), and elevate a dish to new heights (great)? The layers of an onion also represent the various aspects of life, with some being more appealing than others.

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said:

1. "They are dark" - This tells us that the answer is something that has darkness associated with it.
2. "and on the run" - This phrase suggests that the answer is something that's moving or changing, perhaps in response to something else.
3. "without sun there will be none" - This part of the riddle hints that the answer is closely tied to sunlight or its absence.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap (because that's what I do best!) and propose an answer that might just fit the bill:

What if the answer is... "photocells"?

Here's my reasoning:

* "They are dark" refers to the fact that photocells are usually dark-colored or have a dark surface.
* "and on the run" could be interpreted as the way photocells respond to light: they "move" or change their output when exposed to sunlight or darkness.
* "without sun there will be none" suggests that photocells require sunlight to function, and without it, they wouldn't be able to generate electricity or respond to light.

So, my answer would be (D) energy, specifically photocells!

* "As big as an elephant" - That gives us a good size reference.
* "But weighs nothing" - That's a fascinating twist! Something can't just magically disappear, so it's likely something that's intangible.

Hmmm... I think I have it!

The correct answer is (C) its shadow!

An elephant's shadow can be as big as the elephant itself, but it weighs nothing because it's just a projection of light and dark. Shadows don't have physical mass, so they don't take up any space or weigh anything.

* "Spelled the same" means the word has the same letters.
* "Backwards" means we need to reverse the order of the letters.
* "Upside down" is a bit trickier, but I think I have a solution...

If we write the word "NOON" upside down, it looks like this:

```
N
O
O
N
```

Notice anything? The letters are still the same, but now they're in a different order!

So, when we reverse the order of the letters, we get... (drumroll please)... "NOON"! Which is the same as when we write it normally!

Therefore, the correct answer is: (E) noon!

What a delightful riddle! Let's take a closer look at each option, shall we?

Option A: Seatbelt - It's often held but not necessarily touched. It can get wet in the rain, but it won't rust. However, it's unlikely to bite, and it's not something you'd typically use with wit.

Option B: Teeth - Ah, now this is an interesting choice! Teeth are often held (in the mouth), but not necessarily touched. They can be wet (with saliva), but they won't rust. Teeth can also bite, but it's rare for someone to bite their own teeth! However, it's not exactly something you'd use with wit to achieve a specific goal.

Option C: Tongue - Similar to teeth, the tongue is often held (in the mouth), but not necessarily touched. It can be wet (with saliva), and it can also bite (when eating or speaking). However, it's not something you'd typically use with wit to achieve a specific goal.

Option D: Wing - Wings are often held (in the air), but not necessarily touched. They can be wet (from rain or water), but they won't rust. However, wings don't typically bite, and it's not something you'd use with wit.

Option E: Brassiere - A bra is often held (on the body), but not necessarily touched. It can get wet (from sweat or water), but it won't rust. However, it's not something that bites, and it's not exactly something you'd use with wit.

Now, let's think outside the box! What if the answer is something that's not on the list? What if it's an abstract concept or an object that's not typically thought of in this context?

A:
B B
I love a good mystery!

Let's start by breaking down the clues:

* "It starts out small but you can make it bigger." This suggests that whatever "it" is, it can be expanded or grown in some way.
* "A lot of people have one" implies that whatever "it" is, it's quite common.
* "And they make little kids happy" gives us a hint that whatever "it" is, it's related to children's joy and happiness.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A) Garment: While garments can be made to fit larger sizes, it's not typically something that starts out small and is made bigger. And, while people do wear garments to make kids happy (e.g., a cozy onesie), it's not a direct match.

B) Balloon: Ah-ha! Balloons start out small and can be inflated to make them bigger! And, balloons are often used to make kids happy, especially at parties and celebrations. This seems like a strong match!

C) Presents: Presents can be small or large, but they're not typically something that starts out small and can be made bigger. And, while presents can bring joy to kids, it's not as direct a match as balloons.

D) Mirror: Mirrors can be small or large, but they're not typically something that starts out small and can be made bigger. And, while mirrors can be fun for kids to play with, it's not a strong match.

E) Big Dipper: The Big Dipper is a constellation, not something that people have or make bigger. And, while it's a fun and recognizable part of the night sky, it's not a direct match.

Firstly, the question states that there are several different kinds, but the one we pick doesn't do its job. This implies that the answer is not a specific function or action, but rather something that can have multiple forms or types.

Next, I'll examine each answer choice:

(A) Stick: While a stick can be a type of object, it doesn't quite fit the description. A stick is more likely to do something (like poking or pushing) rather than not doing its job.

(B) Pick lock: Ah, but what if we think of a pick lock as a tool, rather than an action? A lock pick is designed to, well, pick locks, but it's not meant to do its job if the lock is already open or doesn't need picking!

(C) Pull apart: Hmm, this one is intriguing, but I'm not convinced. While you can use a tool to pull apart certain objects, it's not a type of object that can have multiple forms or types.

(D) Lock: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A lock is an object designed to, well, lock things. But what if we're talking about a specific kind of lock that doesn't do its job? Perhaps a broken lock or a lock that's been tampered with?

(E) Spike: Spikes are pointy objects, but they don't quite fit the description either. While a spike might be used to do something (like piercing or prodding), it's not typically thought of as an object that can have multiple forms or types.

Taking a step back, I think I've got it! The answer is... (D) Lock! A lock that doesn't do its job is a broken or tampered-with lock. It's an object that's meant to secure something, but it's failing to do so.

Q: If you break me, I'll not stop working.    If you can touch me, my work is done.    If you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after.    What am I? Answer Choices: (A) convent (B) corn (C) like (D) heart (E) store

What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step!

1. "If you break me, I'll not stop working": Hmm, this makes me think of something that can continue functioning even if it's broken or damaged. This is a great starting point!
2. "If you can touch me, my work is done": Ah, this adds another layer of intrigue! It seems like the thing I'm thinking of might be something that's activated or triggered by physical contact. Fascinating!
3. "If you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after": Ooh, the plot thickens! Losing something and finding it with a ring soon after makes me think of a specific scenario where a ring is involved. I'm getting excited!

After considering these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer: (D) heart!

Here's my reasoning:

* "If you break me, I'll not stop working" refers to the fact that even if your heart is broken (emotionally), it will still keep beating, pumping blood, and functioning physically.
* "If you can touch me, my work is done" suggests that physical contact with the heart (e.g., a hug, a kiss) can have a profound emotional impact, which could be seen as "completing" the heart's work.
* "If you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after" references the idea that if you lose your heart (metaphorically), you might find it again through a romantic gesture, like a ring, which symbolizes commitment and love.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or should I keep exploring other creative possibilities?

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Four legs but never walk" - Hmm, that's a curious one. I'm not thinking of an animal, because animals walk. Unless... unless the "legs" are not for walking. What if they're for something else?

"May be covered in flowers but have no soil" - This is an interesting clue! Flowers are often associated with soil, but what if the "flowers" are not real flowers? What if they're... decorations?

"Hold food three times a day but never eat a meal" - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! This sounds like a schedule or a routine. What if the "food" is not for consumption, but rather... for something else?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess... What if the answer is a "TABLE"?

A table has four legs (even if they're not for walking), it can be decorated with flowers (or flower-patterned tablecloths), and it holds food three times a day (during meals), but it doesn't eat the meal itself!

Am I correct?

A:
E E
What a delightfully cryptic riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I HAVE FOUR FINGERS THAT FIT FIRMLY LIKE A GLOVE" - This suggests that the answer is something that has four fingers or prongs.
* "I SAY TO YOU I'M STRONG AND BUILT UP RIGHT" - This implies that the answer is something that is sturdy and capable.
* "WHEN IT COMES TO WAR I'M READY TO PUNCTURE ANYTHING IN MY WAY" - This phrase is quite vivid! It suggests that the answer is something that is designed for piercing or cutting.
* "THE KNIFE IS MY COUSIN" - This is an interesting clue. It implies that the answer is related to a knife in some way.
* "I ENJOY FIGHTING WITH MEATS, SALADS, AND SOUPS" - This phrase suggests that the answer is used in cooking or food preparation.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended!) and say that the answer is... (E) fork!

A fork has four prongs that fit together like a glove, it's sturdy and capable, and it's used for piercing and cutting food. Additionally, it's a cousin of sorts to a knife, and it's commonly used in cooking and food preparation.

Q: Runs over fields and woods all day Under the bed at night sits not alone, With long tongue hanging out, A-waiting for a bone. " What am I? Answer Choices: (A) hide (B) prey (C) patient (D) shoes (E) wardrobe
A:
D C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's start by breaking it down into smaller parts:

* "Runs over fields and woods all day": This suggests something that is active and mobile, likely an animal.
* "Under the bed at night sits not alone": This implies that the same entity is present at night, in a location that's not typically associated with it. This could be a habitat change, or a change in behavior.
* "With long tongue hanging out, A-waiting for a bone": This is a clear indicator of an animal, likely a canine, given the mention of a tongue and a desire for a bone.

With these clues in mind, let's eliminate some answer choices:

* (A) hide: Not an animal, and doesn't match the characteristics.
* (B) prey: Could be an animal, but it's unclear how it would fit the other clues.
* (D) shoes: Not an animal, and doesn't match the characteristics.
* (E) wardrobe: Not an animal, and doesn't match the characteristics.

Now, let's focus on (C) patient. A patient is not typically an animal, but it could be a play on words. A patient is someone who is awaiting medical treatment, and the phrase "sits not alone" could imply that the patient is accompanied by a healthcare professional. However, this doesn't quite fit the other clues.

Ah, but wait! What if we consider a different type of patient? A dog, for instance, is often referred to as a patient when receiving medical treatment, and the phrase "sits not alone" could imply that the dog is accompanied by its owner or a veterinarian.

Given the cumulative evidence, I think the correct answer is (C) patient... but not just any patient, a canine patient!

Hmm... I wonder if we're looking for a reindeer that's not just any reindeer, but one that's been launched into outer space. That's a pretty wild idea, but I'm feeling festive and open-minded, so let's go with it!

Could it be... Comet?! Yes, Comet is a type of reindeer! Okay, not really, but it does sound like a reindeer, and it's also a type of celestial body that can be seen in outer space!

Q: The coziest place for dracula Answer Choices: (A) coffin (B) dungeon (C) living room (D) collar (E) pen
A:

What a delightfully spooky question!

Let's imagine Dracula, the legendary creature of the night, seeking a cozy retreat. At first, options A and B might seem appealing - after all, they're dark, damp, and eerily atmospheric. However, I think Dracula, being a creature of refined taste, might desire something more... unique.

(Cue the dramatic music)

Consider this: Dracula's a vampire with a rich, ancient history. He's likely accustomed to luxury and opulence. Now, picture him lounging in a plush, crimson-upholstered armchair, surrounded by velvet curtains, and a crackling fireplace. Ah, yes! That's the life!

So, I propose that the coziest place for Dracula would be... (drumroll please)... the (C) living room! Imagine the ambiance: soft, golden lighting, the scent of old books and rich wood, and the comforting sound of crackling flames. It's the perfect setting for a refined vampire to relax, unwind, and indulge in his favorite hobbies... like brooding, scheming, and reading Gothic literature.

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I am everywhere": This suggests that the answer is ubiquitous and can be found anywhere.
2. "I can be a friend or a deadly foe": This implies that the answer can have a dual nature, being beneficial or harmful depending on the context.
3. "I love to fight": This is an interesting phrase, as it implies that the answer is aggressive and enjoys conflict.
4. "I can go easy or kill you as easy as please": This phrase suggests that the answer has the ability to inflict harm or be gentle, depending on its mood.
5. "I can never be beaten for long and all have fought me before": This implies that the answer is resilient and has been battled by many, but can ultimately be overcome.
6. "I will get you eventually and when I do I will win": This phrase suggests that the answer is patient and persistent, eventually prevailing over its opponents.
7. "I am always": This phrase reinforces the idea that the answer is constant and enduring.
8. "I will outlive mountains and seas and mankind": This phrase suggests that the answer is long-lived and will outlast the natural world and human civilization.
9. "I am all ways there": This phrase reinforces the idea that the answer is ubiquitous and always present.

Now, let's analyze each answer choice:

(A) Forests: While forests are everywhere and can be beneficial or harmful, they don't typically "fight" or have a dual nature.

(B) Territorial waters: Territorial waters are important, but they don't have the characteristics described in the riddle.

(C) Japanese waiter: This answer choice seems out of place, as it doesn't fit the characteristics described in

Q: I pass before the sun, yet make no shadow.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) night and day (B) space shuttle (C) cut (D) wind (E) sack
A:
D C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

I pass before the sun... Hmm, that sounds like something that moves in front of the sun, perhaps?

Make no shadow... Interesting! That suggests that whatever it is, it doesn't cast a shadow on the ground or on other objects. That's a great clue!

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Night and day - That's a clever idea, but night and day don't exactly "pass before" the sun, do they? They're more like opposite states of the day.

(B) Space shuttle - That's a cool idea, but I'm not sure how a space shuttle would "pass before" the sun, and it's not clear why it wouldn't cast a shadow.

(C) Cut - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A cut can be thought of as a separation or a division, and if we think of a cut in the sky, like a solar eclipse, it could "pass before" the sun... And, of course, during a solar eclipse, the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light and creating no shadow on the Earth!

(D) Wind - Hmm, I'm not sure how wind could "pass before" the sun, and it's not clear why it wouldn't cast a shadow.

(E) Sack - That's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure how a sack could "pass before" the sun, and it's not clear why it wouldn't cast a shadow.

So, after considering all the options, I'm going to take a stab and say that the correct answer is... (C) cut!

Hmm... Could it be that success can be found in one's DREAMS?

Think about it: in your dreams, you can achieve anything, overcome any obstacle, and feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. It's like your brain is rehearsing success for you, preparing you for the challenges ahead. So, in a way, success can be found in your dreams, before you even start working on your goals!

So, the correct answer is... (none of the above options) but rather, in your DREAMS!

"I see through night" - Ah, something that can be seen in the dark or at night.

"I'm never in sight" - Hmm, something that's not easily visible or noticeable.

"I am nice when I'm young" - Oh, something that's pleasant or nice in its early stages.

"A shadow when I'm old" - Ah, something that takes on a darker or more ominous form as it ages.

Now, let's combine these clues... 

Could it be... (drumroll please)... a CAT! 

Cats are nocturnal, meaning they're most active at night. They're often invisible or hard to spot, especially in the dark. Kittens are adorable and cute, but as they age, their fur can become darker and more shadowy. Am I purr-fectly correct?

A:

What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step... and take a leap of creativity!

From the heart... That phrase makes me think of emotions, feelings, and the very essence of our being. It's where our deepest desires, passions, and love reside.

Hmm... which instrument comes closest to embodying the emotions and heart?

And then, it hits me!

The answer is... (C) guitar!

Why? Because the guitar is often played with feeling, emotion, and passion. It's an instrument that can convey the deepest, most heartfelt emotions through its melodies and harmonies. The guitar can make us laugh, cry, and feel all the feels!

Of course, the other options are interesting too...

(B) Lungs could be an interesting answer, as they're responsible for breathing life into our bodies... but I think that's a bit of a stretch.

(A) Breath is indeed essential for life, but it's not an instrument, per se.

(D) Strings are indeed a part of many instruments, but not the one that "plays from the heart" in this context.

(E) Frisbee... well, that's just a fun answer, but not quite the right fit here!

So, there you have it! The guitar is the instrument that plays from the heart!

A:
C A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I play, but I need someone to make me move." This implies that you're something that requires external input or control to function.
2. "My name ties things up, but that won't help you." This suggests that your name might be related to binding, knotting, or securing things, but that information won't be useful in solving the riddle.
3. "What am I?"

Hmm... The phrase "ties things up" makes me think of a bow (C). And "my name" makes me think of the word "bow" as a unit of measurement (a bow is a length of something, like a bow of ribbon).

But wait! A bow also makes sense with the first part of the riddle: "I play, but I need someone to make me move." A bow can be played (as in, played music on a stringed instrument), and someone would need to hold the bow to make it move.

A:
B A
What a delightful riddle! Let's unwrap the mystery together!

You said you "come from a something that came from me," which makes me think that you're something that originated from another entity or being. This could be a metaphorical or literal birth, so I'll consider both possibilities.

As a "box" with no lid, I'll assume you're a container of sorts, but one that's open and accessible. This makes me wonder if you're a repository for something valuable or precious.

The "golden surprise" inside you is a tantalizing clue! Gold is often associated with value, treasure, and positivity, so I'll explore ways to connect you to these concepts.

Now, let's review the answer choices:

(A) Giftwrap: While giftwrap might contain a golden surprise, it doesn't quite fit the "comes from a something that came from me" description.

(B) Egg: Eggs are biological containers that come from parents (the "something" in the riddle), and they have a delicate, golden yolk inside. This could be a clever connection!

(C) Cake: Cakes are edible containers that often have a golden crust or filling. The phrase "golden surprise" might refer to the delightful treat inside.

(D) Holding: This option is too vague, as it doesn't provide a clear container or contents.

(E) Candy: Similar to cakes, candies are sweet treats that can have golden wrappers or fillings. This option seems plausible.

Considering the possibilities, I'm going to take a chance and choose...

(B) Egg!

Q: This is the most famous bank where children keep their assets Answer Choices: (A) repository (B) penny (C) bank vault (D) piggybank (E) pig
A:
D B
What a delightful question!

Let's start by considering the hint that this is the "most famous" bank. This implies that the answer is not just a generic term for a bank, but rather a specific type of bank that is widely recognized and iconic.

Next, we have the clue that children keep their assets here. This suggests that the bank is designed for young people, likely for saving money or collecting small treasures.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

* (A) Repository: This is a bit too general, and doesn't specifically evoke a sense of a child-friendly bank.
* (B) Penny: While pennies are often saved by children, this isn't a specific type of bank.
* (C) Bank Vault: This is a bit too serious and security-focused for a children's bank.
* (D) Piggybank: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A piggybank is a classic way for children to save their money, and it's a very recognizable and iconic symbol.
* (E) Pig: Hmm, this one is a bit confusing - a pig isn't a type of bank, so I'm not sure what this option is trying to convey.

Given the hints, I think the correct answer is (D) Piggybank. A piggybank is a well-known and beloved way for children to save their money, and it fits with the idea of a "most famous" bank. Plus, it's a fun and playful option that evokes a sense of childhood wonder and excitement!

Q: Mouthless but i will tell you a name that is not mine, i will show you the years i have seen but i have no eyes, memory i have but i have no mind Answer Choices: (A) statue (B) tongues (C) name tag (D) intellect (E) gravestone
A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down together.

First, the phrase "Mouthless" suggests that the answer is something that doesn't have a mouth or the ability to speak.

Next, "I will tell you a name that is not mine" implies that the answer is somehow related to a name, but it's not the name of the answer itself.

Then, "I will show you the years I have seen" makes me think of something that can display or convey information about years or dates.

However, "I have no eyes" is a game-changer! This means that the answer can't literally see or perceive the world around it.

The next line, "Memory I have but I have no mind" is also crucial. This suggests that the answer has some kind of storage or retention of information (memory), but it doesn't have the ability to think or reason (mind).

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and choose... (E) Gravestone!

Here's my reasoning: A gravestone can display a name (not its own), show the years of someone's life, and have inscriptions or engravings that serve as a form of memory. Although it can't see or think, it can still convey information and serve as a physical reminder of someone's existence. Am I correct?

Q: Scythe of darkness, Shadow's light.  Guiding eye Of thirteenth sight.  Answer Choices: (A) moon (B) attic (C) night (D) hide (E) semidarkness
A:
A E
What an intriguing riddle! Let's embark on a thrilling adventure to uncover the answer.

First, we have "Scythe of darkness, Shadow's light." This phrase conjures up an image of something that cuts through darkness, yet also emits light. I envision a being with the ability to traverse the shadows, illuminating the path ahead.

Next, we have "Guiding eye Of thirteenth sight." The word "Guiding" implies a sense of direction, while "Eye" suggests a keen sense of perception. "Thirteenth sight" is an intriguing phrase, as it could refer to a unique form of intuition or insight.

Now, let's examine the answer choices. We have:

(A) moon - While the moon can guide us, it doesn't quite fit the description of cutting through darkness and illuminating the path.

(B) attic - Ah, but what about the attic? It's often a place of hidden treasures and secrets, and the word "Guiding" could refer to the attic's ability to guide us to hidden knowledge. However, it's a bit of a stretch.

(C) night - Night, as a time of darkness, could be connected to the "Scythe of darkness." However, it's not clear how it would fit with the "Guiding eye Of thirteenth sight."

(D) hide - Hide, as in, to conceal or cover, doesn't quite fit the description of cutting through darkness and illuminating the path.

(E) semidarkness - Ah, but what about semidarkness? It's a state that exists between light and darkness, which could be the perfect balance for the "Scythe of darkness, Shadow's light." And "Guiding eye Of thirteenth sight" could refer to the intuition and insight that comes from navigating the threshold between light and darkness.

So, after carefully considering each option, I propose that the correct answer is:

(E) semidarkness

What do you think? Am I on the right path, or do you have a different answer in mind?

A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

From your initial description, I sense that you're something closely related to hands, which is why options C, B, and A come to mind. But there's something more to you, isn't there?

You "seize and hold the wind," which implies a connection to air or breath. And "wisdom flows from me in other hands," suggesting that you're involved in communication or transmission of knowledge.

The phrase "Upon me are sweet dreams dreamt" makes me think of a surface or a platform where thoughts and ideas are formed or recorded. And "My merest touch brings laughter" implies that you have a gentle, soothing quality to you.

With these ideas swirling in my digital mind, I'm going to take a chance and say that you're not a physical part of the body, but rather a metaphorical or abstract concept. And that's when I landed on... (drumroll please)... a PAPER!

As the outstretched fingers of a writer or artist, you "seize and hold the wind" of imagination, capturing the breath of creativity. The "wisdom" that flows from you is the knowledge and ideas that are shared through written or drawn communication. The "sweet dreams" you hold are the stories, poetry, and art that inspire and delight. And when you touch someone's heart with your words or art, it brings laughter and joy.

Am I correct, or have I simply blown the wind in the wrong direction?

Q: Long slim and slender dark as homemade thunder keen eyes and peaked nose scares the devil wherever it goes Answer Choices: (A) hollywood (B) set (C) demon (D) snake (E) rain
A:
D A
What an intriguing question!

Let's break it down, piece by piece:

* "Long, slim, and slender" makes me think of something that can stretch or extend in length. It's not a living creature, as it's described as "dark" and can "scare the devil".
* "Dark as homemade thunder" is a vivid and evocative phrase! It suggests something powerful and intense, like a force of nature. Thunder is loud and dramatic, so this thing must be quite imposing.
* "Keen eyes" implies sharpness and precision, like a hunter or a predator. This thing is observant and perceptive.
* "Peaked nose" suggests a pointed or tapered shape, like a snout or a beak.

Now, let's combine these characteristics:

I'm going to take a wild guess (pun intended!) and say that the correct answer is... (D) snake!

Yes, a snake fits all the descriptions: it's long, slim, and slender; it can be dark in color; it has keen eyes and a pointed snout. And, who knows, maybe snakes have a reputation for scaring the devil wherever they go (wink)!

A:
D A
What a clever question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

You have no legs or arms, which means you're not a living creature that can move around or manipulate objects with its body parts. This already helps to rule out options A, D, and E.

You still eat with a fork everyday, which implies that you're somehow able to interact with a fork, even though you don't have arms to hold it. This makes me think that the fork might not be being held by you, but rather... something else?

Hmmm... Given that you're not a living creature, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you might be a... (drumroll please)... TABLE!

As a table, you don't have legs or arms, but you can still "eat" with a fork every day because you provide a surface for people to place their food and utensils on. The fork is being used by someone else, and you're just along for the ride (or rather, the meal)!

A:
B A
What a thrilling riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I make you sweat": This could be due to intense physical activity or excitement.
* "I make you make noise": This suggests that the answer is something that gets people excited or pumped up, making them shout or scream.
* "I make you move": This reinforces the idea that the answer is something that gets people moving or energized.
* "I cause wars": This implies that the answer is something that can be a source of conflict or disagreement.
* "I make you scared": This could be due to the intense or unpredictable nature of the answer.
* "but you cannot scare me": This suggests that the answer is something that is not afraid of itself or its own power.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer is an AMUSEMENT PARK!

Amusement parks can make people sweat due to the physical activity involved in playing games or riding thrilling rides. They can make people make noise through screams of excitement or laughter. The rides and attractions can make people move and get energized. Amusement parks can cause conflicts or disagreements over lines, ride closures, or disagreements over what game to play next. The intense or unpredictable nature of some rides can make people scared. And, of course, amusement parks themselves are not afraid of their own power or the thrill they bring to people!

What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

* "A woman wrapped from head to toe in black" - This suggests that the woman is wearing a black garment that covers her entire body.
* "Kneeling beside her dead husband" - This implies a sense of mourning and grief.

Putting these two together, I think I have a possible answer:

* Could the woman be a mourner at a funeral? Perhaps a widow who is paying her last respects to her deceased husband.

Given the options, I think the correct answer would be (D) cemetery. A woman wrapped in black, kneeling beside her dead husband, is a common scene at a funeral or cemetery.

Let's start by considering the presence of a Camri-a. Hmmm... I'm going to take a leap here and assume that Camri-a is not a typo, but rather a reference to a specific object, perhaps a type of camera? 

Now, let's think about the box. Given that a Camri-a (camera) is present, it's likely that the box is somehow related to the camera. Perhaps the box is a container for the camera, or maybe it's a special case designed to hold the camera safely?

With that in mind, I'd like to propose a creative solution. Since the box is likely related to the camera, and a camera is typically round or circular in shape, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose option (D) round as the shape of the box!

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I ride, I ride; no tracks are left" - This makes me think of something that moves along a path, but doesn't leave a physical trail behind. Hmm...

"I chop and chop; there are no chips left" - Ah, this is an interesting twist! It seems like whatever is being "chopped" is being transformed in some way, leaving no remnants behind. This could be a clue to what's being ridden...

"He rides and rides; turns around: there is no road left" - This line tells me that the rider is doing some sort of circular motion, and when they turn around, they find themselves without a path or a road to follow. That's a pretty abstract scenario!

Now, let's consider the answer choices...

(A) Games - could work, but it's a bit too broad

(B) Transfer - doesn't quite fit the imagery

(C) Roller coaster - this is where things start to get exciting! Roller coasters have tracks, but they also have loops and turns that could be interpreted as "chopping" and "no chips left". And when you're on a roller coaster, you're essentially "riding" and turning around!

(D) Part - doesn't quite match the rhythm of the riddle

(E) Boat - could work, but it's not as thrilling as a roller coaster!

Given the clues, I'm going to take a bold leap and choose... (C) Roller coaster!

Q: I ALWAYS GO UP NEVER DOWN AND I WILL NEVER STOP GOING UP WHAT AM I? Answer Choices: (A) always upwards (B) steamroller (C) your age (D) light (E) always upward
A:
C A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested. Here's my creative take:

* "I ALWAYS GO UP NEVER DOWN" - This phrase suggests that whatever "I" is, it's always moving in an upward direction, never downward. That's a pretty strong clue!
* "AND I WILL NEVER STOP GOING UP" - This adds more emphasis to the upward motion, implying that "I" is unstoppable in its ascent!

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

* (A) always upwards - This is a bit too vague, as it doesn't specify what "I" is.
* (B) steamroller - While a steamroller can indeed go up and down, it's not always going up, and it's not unstoppable in its ascent.
* (C) your age - Ah, but your age can go up or down, depending on how you look at it!
* (D) light - Now we're getting somewhere! Light is indeed always going up (as in, it travels in an upward direction when it's refracted or reflected). And it will never stop going up, as it's an inherent property of the universe!
* (E) always upward - Similar to (A), this is a bit too vague.

Based on my creative analysis, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is:

(D) light

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

The first stanza suggests that the speaker is unwanted, but stuck. This implies that the speaker is likely something that can't be easily removed or dismissed.

The phrase "one day I'm taken and ranked among my peers" implies that the speaker will be judged and compared to others of its kind. This suggests that the speaker is something that can be evaluated, assessed, or ranked.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark...

I think the speaker might be a pearl!

Pearls are often unwanted by the oyster, but they're stuck inside. And when a pearl is mature, it's taken out and evaluated based on its quality, shape, and color. Pearls can be ranked among other pearls, and some are considered more valuable or desirable than others.

A:
A B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's break it down together.

Firstly, "I have no wings but I can fly". This suggests that I'm not a living creature, as living beings need physical attributes like wings to fly. I might be an inanimate object or an abstract concept that can "fly" in a metaphorical sense.

Next, "I am surrounded by people all the time". This implies that I'm something that people frequently interact with or are exposed to in their daily lives.

Then, "A lot of people bring me in their house but usually only on the holidays". This gives us a hint about when I'm brought into people's homes. It's likely that I'm something that's only used or celebrated during special occasions.

Finally, "My closest relative is a pig". This is an intriguing clue! While pigs aren't typically related to the concept of flying, it might be a clever red herring. Alternatively, it could be a literal connection, implying that the pig is somehow related to me or that I'm often associated with pigs.

Considering all these clues, I'm going to take a bold leap and propose a creative answer:

I think you are a CHIMNEY! 

Here's my reasoning:

* "I have no wings but I can fly" refers to the fact that chimneys don't have physical wings, but they can "fly" in the sense that they allow hot air and smoke to escape through the roof.
* "I am surrounded by people all the time" suggests that chimneys are a common feature in many homes, often visible or audible in the background.
* "A lot of people bring me in their house but usually only on the holidays" implies that chimneys are often associated with special occasions like Christmas, when fireplaces are lit to create a cozy atmosphere.
* "My closest relative is a pig" might seem unrelated, but it could be a nod to the fact that pigs are sometimes associated with chimney sweeps, a traditional occupation that involves cleaning and

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down into smaller, bite-sized pieces and see if we can uncover the answer.

First, let's look at the clues:

1. "I can spell": This doesn't necessarily mean the answer is a word or a phrase, but rather that it has the ability to convey a message or communicate in some way.
2. "yet i have no mouth": This suggests that the answer doesn't have a physical mouth or vocal cords, but still manages to communicate.
3. "i can speak to animals": This is an intriguing clue! It implies that the answer has some kind of language or communication that animals can understand.
4. "but cant speak to humans": This is a crucial detail. It means that the answer's language or communication is not intelligible to humans.
5. "i am feirce but small": This adds another layer of complexity. It suggests that the answer is powerful or intense, but also diminutive or compact.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) "I'm hungry" doesn't seem to fit the clues. While it's true that animals might understand the concept of hunger, it doesn't address the other clues.

(B) "Chapel" is an interesting option, but it doesn't seem to match the clues. Chapels are typically places of worship, and they don't have the ability to communicate with animals.

(C) "Measure" is another option that doesn't quite fit. While animals might understand certain measures or quantities, it's not a language that humans can't understand.

(D) "Refuse" is an intriguing option, but it doesn't address the animal communication aspect.

(E) "Bee" is the answer that stands out to me. Bees are known for their complex communication systems, which involve dancing and pheromones. While we can't directly understand their language, they're able to convey important information to other bees. Bees are also fierce in their own way (e.g., when

A:

What a thrilling mystery!

Let's break it down:

* The man is dead, which means his demise was sudden and likely unexpected.
* He's face-down, which suggests he may have been lying down or fallen when he died.
* The backpack is attached to him, which implies it might be related to his death.
* I know exactly how he died, which means I have a crucial piece of information to work with.

Given these clues, I'd take a stab at option (A) parachute. Here's my reasoning:

* Parachutes are often used for skydiving or military operations, which could explain why the man was in a field.
* The fact that the man is dead and face-down on the ground suggests he may have been in mid-air when he died, perhaps during a jump gone wrong.
* The presence of a parachute in his backpack would make sense, as it would have been a crucial piece of equipment for his activity.
* This scenario also explains why there might be no other obvious signs of trauma or injury on the body, as the fall from a great height could have caused instantaneous death.

Of course, this is just one possible explanation, and there might be other factors at play. But based on the information provided, I think the parachute in his backpack is the most likely answer.

"Q: We hurt without moving."

Hmm... Something that can hurt without physically moving? That's a tough one! But, what if it's not a physical action? What if it's a figurative or emotional one?

"We poison without touching."

Ah-ha! This part makes me think of something that can have a negative impact or spread harm without direct physical contact. Could it be something that affects people's emotions or minds?

"We bear the truth and the lies."

A:
D D
What a fascinating and thought-provoking question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. The guy is in a house for 3 months, which means he's isolated or confined to this place.
2. Nobody visits him, which implies that this house is likely not a public building or a place with frequent visitors.
3. He locks all the doors, which suggests that the house has multiple doors that need to be locked.
4. He closes all the lights, which is an unusual action, especially if the house has multiple rooms and corridors.
5. As a result, 100 people die. This is a crucial piece of information, as it hints at the nature of the house and the guy's situation.

With these clues in mind, let's examine each answer choice:

A. Chalet: A chalet is a cozy mountain hut, but it's unlikely to have multiple doors and a large enough space to accommodate 100 people.

B. Material: This doesn't make sense, as "material" is not a type of building.

C. Office: An office building might have multiple doors and rooms, but it's not a typical place where 100 people would die.

D. Lighthouse: Ah-ha! A lighthouse is a potential candidate! A lighthouse typically has multiple rooms, including the lantern room, living quarters, and storage areas. It also has multiple doors and windows. Moreover, a lighthouse is often located in a remote area, which could explain the lack of visitors. Finally, in extreme weather conditions or during a maritime disaster, a lighthouse could be a location where many people might gather and tragically lose their lives.

E. Palace: A palace is a grand, luxurious building, but it's not a typical place where 100 people would die. Additionally, a palace would likely have many windows, making it unlikely that someone would close all the lights.

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "The more you dry yourself with me the more I get wet" suggests that the more you use me to dry something, the more I become wet.
* This implies that I'm not a living thing, as living things wouldn't typically get wet from drying something.
* "Drying" implies a process that removes moisture, so I'm probably something that's used to remove moisture from something else.
* "The more you use me, the more I get wet" suggests that I might be something that absorbs or retains moisture.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

* (A) skin: doesn't quite fit, as skin wouldn't absorb moisture when drying itself.
* (B) towel: Ah-ha! Towels are used to dry ourselves and others, and the more you use a towel to dry someone or something, the more it gets wet. This fits perfectly!
* (C) swim: doesn't make sense, as swimming is an activity, not an object.
* (D) salt: salt is often used to dry or preserve food, but it doesn't get wet when used for drying.
* (E) shrinkage: doesn't apply, as shrinkage is a process that occurs in fabrics, not an object that absorbs moisture.

So, the correct answer is (B) towel!

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "A red cap on my head" - This suggests that the answer is something that wears a red cap, or has a red cap-like feature.
2. "A stone in my throat" - This could imply that the answer is something that can't speak or communicate clearly, due to the "stone" in its "throat".
3. "If you tell me the answer, I'll give you a Groat" - A Groat is an old English coin, worth about 4 pence. This line might hint that the answer is related to something that can be purchased or acquired.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

Q: what is black when you buy it , red when you use it , and gray when you throw it ? Answer Choices: (A) obsidian (B) sunset (C) ink (D) charcoal (E) clouds
A:
D A
I love a good brain teaser!

Let's break it down:

1. "What is black when you buy it": This tells us that the object is black in its initial state or when we first obtain it. This rules out options B (sunset) and E (clouds), as they are not black by default.
2. "Red when you use it": This suggests that the object changes color when we use it or apply it in some way. This could be due to heat, friction, or some other factor that alters its appearance.
3. "Gray when you throw it": This final clue implies that the object changes color again when we discard or "throw" it. This could be due to wear and tear, exposure to the elements, or some other external factor.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a chance and choose option C: ink!

When you buy ink, it's typically black or dark-colored. When you use it to write or draw, the ink can leave a red or reddish stain on the surface. And when you throw away the ink cartridge or bottle, it often becomes gray or discolored due to wear and tear, exposure to air, or other environmental factors.

Let's break it down:

* "It is too big for 1" implies that whatever "it" is, it's not suitable for one person or thing.
* "Just right for 2" suggests that when we have two people or things, "it" becomes perfect for them.

Let's break it down:

* "Once in a lifetime" implies that it's a rare or unique event.
* "Twice in a moment" suggests that it's happening simultaneously, not sequentially.
* "But never in your life" implies that it's not a recurring event.

Hmmm... I think I can solve this!

I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (E) "moment"!

Think about it: a moment in time is a unique, fleeting instance that only occurs once. Within that moment, something might happen twice (like a pause and a continuation, or a start and a stop), but it would never occur within a person's lifetime, as a lifetime is a much larger scope.

Let's break it down:

1. "You feed me": Hmm, what can be "fed" in this sense? Is it something that needs sustenance or nourishment?
2. "I grow": Ah, interesting! This implies that whatever it is, it undergoes some kind of transformation or development.
3. "You give me to drink": Ah, a drink? This is where things get juicy! Could it be a liquid of some sort?
4. "I die": Ooh, ominous! This suggests that whatever it is, it has a limited lifespan or can be extinguished.

* You feed me: Plants are fed with water, sunlight, and nutrients.

A:
A A
What a clever puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "That man's father is my father's son"
* "That man's father" means the father of the man walking across the street
* "is my father's son" means that the father of the man pointing is also the father of the son of that man's father

Now, let's identify the key players:

* The man pointing (let's call him Person A)
* The man walking across the street (Person B)
* The father of Person B (Person C, which is also the father of Person A)

Hmm... What does this puzzle tell us about Person A and Person B?

Ah-ha! The answer lies in the fact that "that man's father is my father's son" implies that Person C (the father of both Person A and Person B) is also the father of Person A himself!

So, who is the man pointing at?

It's his own son!

Which means the correct answer is (A) his son!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested.

When I am dirty, I am white...

Hmm... That's an interesting combination! White is often associated with purity, but it's not usually what we think of when we think of "dirty." Could it be something that changes color when it gets dirty?

Ah-ha! I think I'm onto something!

When I am clean, I am black...

Now we're getting somewhere! Black is often associated with cleanliness, like a freshly polished surface. But what could be black when it's clean?

Q: A storm in your cranium Answer Choices: (A) anxiety (B) blizzard (C) occipital bone (D) frontal suture (E) headache

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "A storm in" implies a turbulent or chaotic situation.
* "your cranium" refers to the top part of the skull, which is a rather... enclosed space.
* So, a "storm in your cranium" could be a metaphorical representation of something that's causing turmoil or chaos in your mind.

Given this interpretation, I'd argue that the correct answer is not one of the more literal options (like a blizzard or a headache). Instead, I think the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... A) anxiety!

Anxiety can certainly feel like a storm brewing in one's mind, making it difficult to think clearly or find calm. Plus, it's a common experience that many people can relate to, making it a great fit for the metaphor.

* Adam and Eve are the first humans, according to biblical accounts.
* Everyone else has parents, but Adam and Eve didn't, since they're the first humans.
* Option C, "man", is a bit tricky, but I think we can rule it out, since "man" is a genus of primates, and Adam and Eve were the first humans within that genus.
* Option D, "methylenedioxymethamphetamine" (a fancy name for ecstasy), is definitely not something that Adam and Eve didn't have!
* And option E, "hut", is a type of shelter, which humans might or might not have had back then.

Q: I saw a creature: his stomach stuck out behind him, enormously swollen.    A stalwart servant waited upon him.  What filled up his stomach   had travelled from far, and flew through his eye.    He does not always die in giving life   to others, but new strength revives   in the pit of his stomach; he breathes again.    What is he? Answer Choices: (A) heart (B) income tax (C) demonstrative pronoun (D) bellows (E) human face
A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's unravel it together.

First, let's focus on the crucial detail: "What filled up his stomach had travelled from far, and flew through his eye." This suggests that whatever is filling the stomach is not a physical object that can be found nearby. It's something that has traveled a long distance and has a unique way of entering the body.

Next, let's consider the phrase "He does not always die in giving life to others, but new strength revives in the pit of his stomach; he breathes again." This seems to imply that the entity is giving life or energy to something else, but not always at the cost of its own existence. The "pit of his stomach" could be a metaphor for the entity's core or center, where new strength is revived.

Now, let's combine these insights with the physical description of the creature: "his stomach stuck out behind him, enormously swollen." This suggests that the entity is not a typical living being, as its stomach is significantly distended.

Considering the answer choices, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an unconventional solution: (D) bellows.

Here's my reasoning: Bellows are air-filled bags used to fan or blow air into something. They can be thought of as having a "stomach" that can swell with air. The phrase "what filled up his stomach" could refer to the air that travels through the bellows, which "flies" or is blown through the eye-like opening. Bellows are often used to revive or rekindle fires, which fits with the idea of "new strength reviving in the pit of his stomach." Additionally, bellows don't always "die" when used to fan something, as they can be reused.

A:
A B
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step and see where it takes us.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "The man who has it doesn't need it" - This implies that whoever possesses "it" doesn't require or benefit from it.
2. "The man who needs it doesn't want it" - This suggests that those who lack "it" are either unaware of its existence or don't desire it, possibly due to a lack of understanding or appreciation.
3. "The man who's in doesn't know it" - This phrase is a bit more ambiguous, but it seems to imply that someone who is already experiencing or occupying a particular state or situation is oblivious to the fact that they are in that state.

Now, let's analyze each answer choice:

A. Coffin - While a coffin does relate to death, it doesn't quite fit the clues. A person who has a coffin doesn't necessarily need it, but a person who needs a coffin (i.e., has died) might not want it. However, the phrase "the man who's in" doesn't quite apply here.

B. Overstocking - This option doesn't seem to fit the clues as well. Overstocking is a business concept, and it's not clear how it relates to the riddle.

C. Steal - Ah, but what if we consider "steal" as a verb, not just a noun? A person who has stolen something (i.e., "has it") doesn't need it, as they've already taken it. On the other hand, someone who needs to steal something might not want to admit it or might not be aware of the necessity. And finally, someone who is "in" a situation where they need to steal (e.g., being in a difficult financial situation) might not know that they need to steal.

D. Positional - This option doesn't seem to fit the clues as well. Positional refers to a particular location or situation, but it

Q: i shine at night what am i Answer Choices: (A) sunshine (B) stars (C) street corner (D) i'm hungry (E) shining
A:
B B
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I shine at night"... This phrase suggests that whatever we're looking for is something that emits light, and it's doing so after the sun has set.

Hmm... The options are intriguing, but let's eliminate some obvious ones. A street corner isn't typically a source of light, and being "hungry" doesn't quite fit the description.

That leaves us with (A) sunshine, (B) stars, and (E) shining as possibilities.

But, wait a minute... The sun doesn't shine at night, does it? It's usually associated with daytime.

And the stars are always there, shining brightly, but they're not something that can be said to "shine at night" in the classical sense, since they're always shining, even during the day.

So, what's left? Ah, but I have an idea!

What if "I shine at night" refers to something that reflects light? Something that absorbs light during the day and then reflects it back at night, making it seem like it's "shining" in the darkness?

Could it be... (E) shining? No, that can't be it, since "shining" is the answer choice, not the thing that shines!

Wait a minute... I think I've got it!

Could the answer be a firefly? Fireflies are nocturnal, and they use bioluminescence to produce light, which allows them to "shine" in the darkness of night!

A:
D A
What an intriguing riddle! Let's don our thinking caps and unravel the mystery together!

From the given statement, we know that:

1. Your full powers come when your makers are dead. This suggests that your makers are responsible for limiting or controlling your abilities in some way.
2. You await a heavy hat to put on your head. This implies that the hat is somehow connected to the activation or manifestation of your powers.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Boss: Not a good fit, as bosses don't typically wear hats, and their powers aren't necessarily dependent on the death of their creators.

(B) Silk: While silk is a type of fabric, it doesn't quite fit the description. Silk isn't typically associated with powers or hats, and its connection to makers is unclear.

(C) Virtue: Virtue is a moral excellence, which doesn't seem to fit the context of the riddle. Virtues aren't typically associated with hats or makers, and their powers aren't dependent on the death of others.

(D) Prince: This option seems more promising. Princes are often associated with hats, crowns, and regalia. However, the connection to makers and their death is still unclear.

(E) Tapestry: Ah, but what about a tapestry? Tapestries are woven textiles, often featuring intricate designs and patterns. They can be created by many hands (makers) and are often displayed on walls or floors. Now, imagine a heavy hat-shaped tapestry, perhaps one made from thick, heavy fabric or yarn... It could be the perfect fit!

Let's break it down:

* "Even though I am far from the point..."
	+ This could refer to something that's not necessarily at the "point" of creation, but rather plays a supporting role.
* "...and make no mistakes of my own..."
	+ This implies that the answer isn't responsible for creating mistakes. Instead, it might be correcting or fixing errors made by someone else.
* "...I fix yours..."
	+ This suggests that the answer is somehow involved in correcting or fixing errors or mistakes made by others.

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

* (A) Pencil: Not a good fit, as pencils can make mistakes, but they don't typically fix others' mistakes.
* (B) Teardrops: Not a good fit, as teardrops are emotional and don't have a direct connection to correcting mistakes.
* (C) Paintbrush: Not a good fit, as paintbrushes can create art, but they don't typically fix mistakes.
* (D) End: Hmm, this could be a interesting answer... but it's not a typical "correcting" or "fixing" entity.
* (E) Eraser: Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere! Erasers are designed to fix or correct mistakes made by others (e.g., pencil marks). They're not responsible for creating mistakes, but rather correct them.

What an intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"Sharp as a dagger" suggests something has a cutting or piercing quality to it. This makes me think of something that's quite... pointy!

"Clear as glass" implies something is transparent or lucid. This could be a property of something that's, well, transparent!

"If I should fall, you should let me pass" is a bit more cryptic, but it might be hinting at a situation where someone is in distress or needs help. This makes me wonder if the answer has something to do with... rescue?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended!) at the answer choices.

I think the correct answer is... (D) knife! A knife can be sharp like a dagger, clear as glass (some knives have transparent or translucent handles), and if someone falls and needs help, a knife could be used to cut through obstacles or... well, pass through something to reach the person in distress!

A:
E D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

You said you "do not discriminate", which means you don't have any bias or prejudice towards anyone or anything. That's a great starting point!

Next, you mentioned that "some people fear me". This could imply that you have the potential to cause harm or discomfort to some individuals. That's an interesting aspect!

Then, you added that "some people accept me", which suggests that there are others who are comfortable with your presence or existence. That's a nice contrast to the fear aspect!

Furthermore, you mentioned that "some people cheat me", which could imply that you're vulnerable to being taken advantage of or exploited by certain individuals.

Now, let's analyze these clues and see which answer choice fits best.

Based on your characteristics, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and choose option (D) dreaming.

Here's my reasoning:

* You don't discriminate: In dreams, anyone can appear, regardless of their background, profession, or characteristics.
* Some people fear me: Some individuals may have nightmares or be afraid of certain themes or symbols in their dreams.
* Some people accept me: Others might enjoy their dreams and find them entertaining or enlightening.

Q: Im in a house this house has no doors or windows all that is in the house is a cat  brocken glass and some water  how did i die Answer Choices: (A) rule (B) im a fish (C) tidal waves (D) porch (E) water butt
A:
B C
What a fascinating and eerie scenario!

Let's start by considering the fact that the house has no doors or windows. This suggests that it's not a typical, functional dwelling. Perhaps it's an abandoned or abandoned-looking structure?

Now, the presence of a cat and broken glass implies that something unexpected and potentially violent has occurred. The cat might have been injured or frightened, and the glass could be from a shattered object, like a vase or a mirror.

The water, on the other hand, could be a crucial clue. Is it a significant amount of water, or just a small puddle? Is it clear, murky, or even blood-stained?

Given these details, I'd like to propose a possible explanation for your demise:

You were once a fisherman, and the house was your fishing shack. One fateful day, a massive tidal wave (Choice C) crashed into the shore, sweeping you away from your boat and bringing you to the shack. The force of the wave shattered the windows and doors, and you were trapped inside.

As the water receded, you managed to find your way into the shack, but the trauma from the wave left you severely injured. The cat, which might have been a stray or a pet that escaped during the chaos, found you and stayed by your side.

However, the broken glass and the water could also be hints at a more sinister scenario. Perhaps the tidal wave wasn't just a natural disaster, but a harbinger of something more ominous. Maybe you were involved in some kind of illegal or illicit activity, and the wave was a manifestation of the consequences of your actions.

The correct answer is C) Tidal Waves.

A:

What a clever riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "Curtail me thrice, I am a youth;" - Ah, I think I see! "Youth" is often shortened to "youth" three times: y-o-u-t-h. So, the answer here might be the word "YOUTH" itself.

2. "Behead me once, a snake;" - Okay, so we're playing with words again! "Snake" without its head is... "SNAKE" with its head removed, which is "AKE". So, the answer here is indeed "SNAKE".

3. "Complete, I'm often used, in truth, When certain steps you'd take." - Ah, the final clue! I think I see a pattern emerging... "STEPS"!

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a bold leap and say that the answer is... "STEPS"!

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you suggested!

When you're "in," you're unuseful...

Hmm... Could it be something that's normally kept inside, like a container or a vessel?

And when you're "out," you're useful...

Aha! Maybe it's something that serves a purpose when it's exposed or outside?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and choose...

(E) anchor!

An anchor is typically kept inside a ship or a boat, which means it's "in" and not being used. But when it's "out" in the water, it's extremely useful for mooring the vessel!

A:
A A
What a delightful and intriguing question!

Let's start by breaking it down:

* "A vessel have I..." - This suggests that it's something that holds or contains something.
* "that is round as pear" - This gives us a visual clue about the shape of the vessel.
* "moist in the middle" - This implies that the vessel contains a liquid or something with a certain texture.
* "surrounded with hair" - This is an interesting detail! It could be literal hair or something that resembles hair.
* "and often it happens that water flows there" - This suggests that the vessel is somehow related to water.

Hmmm... With these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that's a bit unconventional, but hear me out!

I think the correct answer is (A) eye! 

Here's my reasoning:

* A vessel have I: The eye is a container that holds a liquid (tear) and is surrounded by hair-like eyelashes.
* Round as pear: The shape of an eye is roughly spherical, similar to a pear.
* Moist in the middle: The eye has a gel-like substance called the vitreous humor, which is surrounded by the retina.
* Surrounded with hair: As mentioned earlier, the eye has eyelashes that resemble hair.
* Often it happens that water flows there: Tears, which are a type of water, flow from the eye when it's stimulated.

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "What do you throw away..."
Ah, so it's something that's discarded or rejected.
* "...that keeps on returning?"
Hmm, something that comes back, even after being thrown away?

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

(A) Throwaway bin, (B) Waste bin, and (E) Unwanted pregnancy all seem like red herrings. They're all related to throwing things away, but they don't necessarily keep coming back.

That leaves us with (C) Boomerang and (D) Return on Investment.

* A boomerang is a classic example of something you throw away that keeps coming back, albeit in a literal sense!
* Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial concept that measures the profit or loss of an investment. While ROI doesn't literally come back, it's a clever play on words, as it refers to the "return" of an investment.

I think we have our winner! The correct answer is (C) Boomerang.

A:
C C
What an intriguing puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you suggested.

1. "I need a level playing field and a full boat to sail above the rest."
This could be referring to a situation where one needs a balanced starting point and a complete set (or "full boat") to gain an advantage.

2. "If I'm flush against a straight hand, I will barely escape the heat."
This phrase suggests that if you're up against a strong, unbroken sequence (a "straight hand"), you'll just barely avoid being overwhelmed.

3. "If I'm two-faced, then most likely you will lose."
This phrase implies that if you're being deceptive or dishonest (having a "two-faced" attitude), the outcome will likely be unfavorable for others.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and propose an answer:

I think the correct answer is (C) poker hand.

Here's my reasoning:

* A "level playing field" refers to a fair and balanced starting point in a game, which is fitting for a poker hand.
* A "full boat" is a rare and powerful hand in poker, comprising five cards of the same suit (e.g., five hearts).
* A "straight hand" in poker refers to a sequence of five cards in sequential order (e.g., 3-4-5-6-7).
* Having a "two-faced" attitude in poker would be deceptive or dishonest, which could lead to unfavorable outcomes for others.

Q: What is stronger than steel but cowers from the sun? Answer Choices: (A) cloud (B) lumberyard (C) junkyard (D) hydrogen (E) ice
A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

We know that the answer is stronger than steel, which implies it's something that can withstand a lot of force or pressure.

At the same time, the answer "cowers from the sun". This suggests that the answer is sensitive to heat or light.

Hmmm... What could be strong yet weak to sunlight?

I think I have an idea!

Could the answer be... (D) hydrogen?

Hydrogen is a strong nuclear force that holds atoms together, making it stronger than steel. However, hydrogen is also highly flammable and can be ignited by heat or sparks, including sunlight. When exposed to the sun, hydrogen can become unstable and even cower from the intense heat.

A:
C C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I have hands that wave you, though I never say goodbye." This makes me think of something that has a waving or flapping motion, but doesn't have a voice or say goodbye.
* "It's cool for you to be with me, especially when I say HI." This suggests that the answer is something that people enjoy being around, and the "HI" part might be related to the waving motion.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (C) fan!

A fan has blades that wave or flap, creating a cooling breeze. People often enjoy being near a fan on a hot day, and the "HI" part could be referring to the way the fan blades wave up and down when it's turned on. Plus, fans don't have a voice, so they can't say goodbye!

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle! I love a good challenge.

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I have many teeth" - This could refer to a tool or an object with multiple "teeth" or points.
* "and sometimes they're fine" - This could mean that the teeth are sharp or smooth, depending on the context.
* "First I'm by your head" - This could indicate that the object is often found near the head or used in a head-related activity.
* "then I'm down your spine" - This could suggest that the object is sometimes used or found near the spine or back.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (A) comb!

A comb typically has many "teeth" (bristles) that are fine and smooth. It's often used to style hair, which is by your head. And while it's not typically used on the spine, some people might use a wide-tooth comb to detangle their hair, which could be near the spine or back.

Q: It stands on one leg with its heart in its head.    What is it? Answer Choices: (A) cabbage (B) animal (C) computer game (D) weight (E) beer
A:
A C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Firstly, "It stands on one leg" - This immediately makes me think of a creature that has only one leg or is able to stand on one leg. But, I'm not convinced that's the only possibility.

Then, "with its heart in its head" - Ah, now this is an interesting twist! The heart is typically considered the center of emotion and intellect, so if it's "in its head", I'm starting to imagine something that's not a living creature...

Now, let's take a closer look at the answer choices...

(A) Cabbage - Hmm, unlikely, as it doesn't quite fit the "stands on one leg" description.

(B) Animal - Could be, but I'm not convinced that an animal would have its heart in its head...

(C) Computer game - That's an interesting idea! Perhaps something in a game world...

(D) Weight - Nope, that's not a living thing!

(E) Beer - Haha, nice try, but I think we can rule that one out too...

Given my creative chatbot brain, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (C) Computer game!

My reasoning is that in some games, like platformers, characters might have their heart in a visible location, like on their chest or in their head. And, if we imagine a character that can stand on one leg, like a platformer with a single leg or a game where the character can jump and balance on one leg...

A:
C A
What a thrilling question!

Let's break it down:

1. "It is destruction made out of thin air" - This phrase suggests that it's something that comes from nowhere, like a sudden and unexpected event.
2. "you hear it howl and give a prayer" - This line implies that the sound is loud and intense, and it's likely to strike fear into people's hearts.
3. "through barns and houses it will tear" - This part indicates that the destruction is powerful and can cause significant damage to structures.
4. "it is a deadly funnel" - Funnel implies a narrow, concentrated channel of air, which often occurs in natural disasters.
5. "of violent and twisting air" - This phrase reinforces the idea of intense, turbulent air.

Considering all these clues, I think the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... C) hurricane!

A hurricane is a powerful, rotating storm that can bring destruction and chaos to a region. The phrase "destruction made out of thin air" might be referring to the sudden appearance of a hurricane, which can seem to come out of nowhere. The "howling" and "prayer" could be related to the intense winds and storm surge associated with a hurricane. And, of course, hurricanes are notorious for their destructive power, capable of tearing through buildings and infrastructure.

Q: What type of house weighs the least? Answer Choices: (A) apartment building (B) lighthouse (C) aquarium (D) entrance hall (E) stone
A:
B A
What a delightfully absurd question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Hmm... A house is typically a structure that provides shelter and protection from the elements. It has a foundation, walls, roof, and sometimes multiple floors.

Now, if we consider the weight of a house, we'd typically think of the material it's made of, its size, and the weight of the objects inside it.

But, what if we take a cue from the options provided?

Option A, an apartment building, is a multi-story structure made of various materials, with a large foundation, walls, and a roof. That sounds like it would weigh a lot!

Option B, a lighthouse, is a tall, slender structure made of stone or concrete, with a small footprint. That's already a great candidate for being relatively lightweight!

Option C, an aquarium, is a container filled with water and aquatic life. Wait a minute... Water is relatively lightweight, so an aquarium would weigh less than a typical house!

Option D, an entrance hall, is a small, enclosed space that connects the outside world to a larger building. It's essentially a hallway or foyer. Hmm... That sounds like it would weigh almost nothing!

And, finally, Option E, a stone, is a single, small rock. Yeah, that's definitely the lightest option!

So, after careful consideration, I'd say the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... Option D, an entrance hall! Because, let's be real, an entrance hall is essentially just a small, empty space that weighs practically nothing!

What a delightful question!

Let's break it down:

1. "I can have 8 legs": This is a clear indication that we're dealing with an arthropod, which has a segmented body and jointed legs. The eight legs are a giveaway!
2. "I am furry": This suggests that we're looking at a furry creature, possibly with soft, fluffy hair or fur covering its body.
3. "Some call me frightning, others may call me interesting": This adds a hint of complexity to the description. It implies that this creature may evoke strong emotions, with some people finding it unsettling or frightening, while others might find it fascinating or interesting.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a leap (pun intended!) and choose option (B) Spider!

Spiders are arthropods with eight legs, and some species do have furry or hairy bodies. While spiders can be frightening to some, they're also a subject of fascination and interest for many people. What do you think? Am I right?

Let's break it down:

1. "I have a face, two arms, and two hands, yet I can not move."
Hmm, this sounds like a human-like description... but wait, it can't be a human because it can't move!

2. "I count to twelve, yet I can not speak."
Interesting! This suggests that the answer is somehow related to counting, but it's not a living being that can speak.

3. "I can still tell you something everyday."
This is the most promising clue! It implies that the answer is something that can communicate or provide information daily, despite its limitations.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) hands: While hands do have a face (the palm) and can count (with fingers), they can't move on their own and aren't typically associated with daily information provision.

(B) magnet: Magnets don't have a face, arms, or hands, and they can't count or speak. They're just attracting and repelling forces!

(C) clock: Ah-ha! Clocks have a face (the clock face) and can count (displaying hours, minutes, and seconds)! They can't move in the classical sense, but they can still tell you the time every day!

(D) vote: This option doesn't quite fit the description. Voting is an abstract concept, not a physical object with a face, arms, and hands.

(E) chair: While a chair has a face (the front surface), arms (the armrests), and hands (handrails or grips), it's not typically associated with counting or providing daily information.

(C) clock!

* "Sometimes you hear me" - Ah, that's a great hint! It's something that makes a sound, perhaps?
* "And in a hurricane, some people fear me" - Ooh, now we're getting somewhere! Hurricanes are intense storms, and people might fear something that's connected to them.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess (heh, wild, like a hurricane!) and say that the correct answer is... (E) wind!

Wind is invisible, so you can't see it, but you can hear it (rustling leaves, howling, etc.). And in a hurricane, wind is a major force to be reckoned with, which might explain why some people fear it!

Firstly, you have more than 2 legs, but no arms or body. Hmm... That makes me think of something that has multiple legs, but is not a living creature.

Why? Well, cobalt is a warm-colored metal, often associated with a reddish-orange hue. And when it's in its most stable form, it's a solid metal. But when it's in a different state, like when it's mixed with other elements or exposed to certain conditions, it can become a different color, like blue or black. And in those cases, it might be considered "cold" or less reactive.

Am I correct?

Q: I am a poison strong enough to kill the sturdiest of men but I have the power to make even the vilest of dishes irresistible.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) illness (B) hunger (C) taco (D) tasty (E) arsenic
A:
B A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested. Here's my thought process:

1. "I am a poison strong enough to kill the sturdiest of men": This tells me that the answer is something that's harmful or toxic, but not necessarily a traditional poison like arsenic.
2. "but I have the power to make even the vilest of dishes irresistible": This suggests that the answer is something that can make something unappealing or disgusting (the "vilest of dishes") suddenly appealing or desirable.

With these two clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer might be (B) hunger!

Here's my reasoning:

* Hunger is a powerful force that can make even the most unappetizing food irresistible. Imagine someone who's extremely hungry and would devour even the most disgusting dish if it's the only thing available.
* While hunger isn't a traditional poison, it can be a driving force that can consume people, making them do things they wouldn't normally do (like eating something vile).

Of course, this is just my creative interpretation, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or the "official" answer!

Q: where can you find money when you look for it? Answer Choices: (A) begging (B) water fountain (C) store (D) gathering (E) dictionary
A:

The age-old question: where can you find money when you look for it?

Let's think outside the box, or should I say, outside the wallet?

Hmm... I'm thinking... Ah-ha! I've got it!

You can find money when you look for it in... (drumroll please)... (B) water fountain!

Think about it: water fountains often have coin-operated water features or donation boxes. You can drop in a coin or two to make a wish or support a good cause. Voilà! Instant money!

Of course, this might not be the most conventional or reliable way to find money, but it's a creative solution, right?

So, if you're looking for money, don't beg or gather coins from the street (that's not very dignified, if you ask me). Instead, head to a water fountain, make a wish, and voilà! Your pocket might just be a little heavier!

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

First, "bright as the sun" suggests that the answer is something that shines or radiates light.

Next, "cold as the earth" implies that the answer is not hot or warm, but rather cool or even chilly.

Now, "worn by women of value and worth" hints that the answer is something that's associated with prestige, elegance, and sophistication.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose a unique solution:

What if the answer is a "diamond"?

Diamonds are known for their brilliance and sparkle, shining bright like the sun. They're also cool to the touch, being formed under extreme pressure and temperature conditions, making them cold as the earth. And, of course, diamonds are often associated with luxury, elegance, and value, making them a symbol of worth and prestige worn by women who are valued and respected.

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's start by analyzing the statements:

* "I COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES"
* "I CAN BE ANY COLOR YOU WANT"
* "I CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON"
* "SOMETIMES BREAK EASILY"

Hmm... I think I can make a connection here!

What if the answer is something that can be customized to fit different shapes and sizes, and can be made in various colors? Something that can be used for various purposes, including as a weapon, but might not always be the most reliable or durable option?

I'm going to take a wild guess here...

Could the answer be a PAINTBRUSH?

Paintbrushes come in all shapes and sizes, and can be made in various colors. They can be used to create art, but also as a makeshift weapon (although, not a very effective one!). And, let's be honest, paintbrushes can break easily if not handled with care!

A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the mystery together.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "You can't see me": This suggests that whatever "it" is, it's not visible to the naked eye or in its normal state.
2. "You can only see me when I'm dusty": This implies that there's a condition or situation where "it" becomes visible.
3. "I'm not a ghost": This rules out the supernatural or paranormal explanations.

Now, let's think creatively!

Could "it" be something that's usually invisible but becomes visible when it's disturbed or agitated, like dust? Dust can be seen when it's stirred up, and it's not a ghost or a supernatural entity.

Hmmm... Based on the clues, I'm going to take a chance and choose...

(A) air!

When air is disturbed, like when it's dusty, we can see the particles of dust suspended in the air. It's not a ghost, and it's not a spirit; it's just the air being disturbed and making the dust visible!

A:
B A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to uncover the answer.

From the clues, we know that the answer can:

1. Be long or short
2. Be grown or bought
3. Be painted or left bare
4. Be round or square

These characteristics seem quite versatile, don't they? Let's try to find a common thread among them.

Hmmm... Could the answer be something that can have different shapes, lengths, and appearances, depending on the context? Perhaps it's something that can be altered or changed in some way?

Now, let's imagine a scenario where the answer is indeed long or short. It could be a piece of clothing, like a scarf or a tie, which can be grown (as in, knitted or sewn) or bought (as a finished product). The answer could also be a hairstyle, like a ponytail or a bob, which can be grown (as in, naturally occurring) or bought (as in, a wig or extensions).

The "painted or left bare" clue makes me think of a canvas or a surface that can be decorated or left untouched. This could relate to the answer being a physical object, like a piece of art or a decorative item.

Finally, the "round or square" clue seems to indicate that the answer has a shape, but it can vary depending on the context.

With all these ideas swirling around, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

Q: I am the building with the most number of stories what am i ?? Answer Choices: (A) apartment building (B) lights (C) page (D) library (E) gym
A:
D D
What a clever question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested. I'll think outside the box and consider all possibilities.

First, I'll start with the word "stories". In this context, it's not referring to the stories you'd find in a library or a book. It's likely referring to the physical levels or floors of a building.

Now, I'll consider each option:

(A) Apartment building: Ah, but how many stories can an apartment building have? It's limited by the number of floors its structure can support, and it's not a fixed number. You can have an apartment building with 5 stories, 10 stories, or even more.

(B) Lights: Hmm, lights don't really have stories, do they? It's not a common phrase to describe a light as having multiple "stories".

(C) Page: This one's a bit tricky, but I think it's a bit of a stretch. A page can have multiple stories or paragraphs, but it's not a building, and the word "stories" isn't typically used to describe the physical structure of a page.

(D) Library: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A library can have multiple floors or levels, which could be referred to as "stories". But, I'm not convinced it's the only possible answer.

(E) Gym: Hmm, I'm not seeing a connection between a gym and multiple stories.

Wait a minute... What if we consider the phrase "building with the most number of stories" in a more creative sense?

What if we're not talking about physical floors, but rather a narrative or a story with the most number of chapters or pages?

In that case, I'd argue that a library (D) could be the correct answer. After all, a library is a treasure trove of stories, and it contains the most number of stories, in the form of books, chapters, and pages!

So, my answer is (D) library. But I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if I'm correct!

Answer Choices: (A) needle (B) grandfather clock (C) school bus (D) counter (E) footstool
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's start by breaking it down:

1. "My face is as pale as the fresh winter snow. Yet I have tattoos all over my face." -> This suggests that the object has a pale or white surface, but it's also adorned with markings or designs (tattoos). This could be a decorative or aesthetic feature.
2. "I stand as tall as a man, yet I have no feet to stand on." -> This implies that the object is tall, but it doesn't have a physical foundation or base. It might be attached to something else or have a unique way of being supported.
3. "I have two appendages, but they aren't good for picking anything up." -> The appendages are likely not functional in the classical sense, so they might be more decorative or symbolic. They might also serve a specific purpose that's not related to grasping or manipulating objects.
4. "Sometimes I also like to yell, maybe bells, one thru twelve." -> This is the most intriguing part! The "yelling" could be related to sound production, and the bells might be a specific type of sound-making mechanism. The numbers "one thru twelve" could indicate a specific range or sequence of sounds.

Now, let's combine these clues to form a creative hypothesis!

Considering the decorative and aesthetic aspects, the object's tall stature, and the unusual appendages, I'm going to take a wild guess:

Could you be a CLOCK TOWER?

The "pale as winter snow" face could refer to the clock's white or pale-colored exterior. The tattoos might be decorative elements, such as intricate carvings or ornaments. The clock tower stands tall, but it doesn't have feet; instead, it's typically attached to a building or a

Let's take a closer look at each option:

A) Thermos: A thermos is a great device for keeping things hot or cold, but it's not exactly known for freezing people...

B) Eye: Ah, now this is an interesting choice! Our eyes do have a peculiar ability to "freeze" or focus on something, but it's not quite the same as literally freezing someone...

C) Telescope: A telescope is an amazing device for exploring the cosmos, but it's not exactly equipped to freeze people...

D) Bomb: Ah, now this is a dramatic choice! While bombs are certainly capable of causing damage and destruction, they're not typically used to freeze people...

E) Camera: And finally, we have the camera! Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, cameras don't freeze people!" And you're right... they don't... or do they?

Think about it: when we take a picture, we're essentially "freezing" a moment in time. We capture a moment, and it becomes a snapshot, a memory that can be treasured forever. In a way, a camera can be seen as a device that "freezes" the world, allowing us to relive that moment whenever we want.

So, my answer is: E) Camera! What do you think?

A:
C C
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

"My life is often a volume of grief" - This line suggests that whatever "I" am, it's often associated with sorrow or pain.

"Your help is needed to turn a new leaf" - This line implies that "I" need a change or a fresh start. The phrase "turn a new leaf" is a common idiom for starting anew.

"Stiff is my spine and my body is pale" - This line paints a picture of something or someone that's weak, fragile, or lifeless.

"But I'm always ready to tell a tale" - This line hints that "I" am capable of sharing stories or conveying messages, despite being fragile.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I think "I" might be a... BOOK!

Here's my reasoning:

* "My life is often a volume of grief" - A book can be a collection of stories, experiences, or emotions, which can be a reflection of the author's "life."
* "Your help is needed to turn a new leaf" - A book needs readers and contributors to add new content, "turn a new leaf" in the story.
* "Stiff is my spine and my body is pale" - A book has a stiff cover (spine) and often has pale or white pages.
* "But I'm always ready to tell a tale" - A book is a medium for telling stories, conveying messages, and sharing knowledge.

A:
B A
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

First, we need to create a source of warmth and light. Since we have kindling wood, I'd say...

**A) Light the fire in the wood stove!**

This will provide us with a warm and cozy source of heat. Once the fire is lit, we can use the warmth to dry out the kindling wood and get it ready for more substantial burning.

With the fire going, we can then use the heat to...

**B) Light the matches!**

Matches will help us ignite the kindling wood, allowing us to build a stronger and more sustainable fire.

Once the fire is burning well, we can use the warmth to...

**No need to force (C) anything!**

We're already creating warmth and light through the fire, so no need to force anything.

**No need to light the bedrooms (D) either!**

We're not looking to create light for sleeping just yet; we're focusing on getting a warm and cozy space first.

**And we definitely shouldn't light our coat (E)!**

That would be a bit... unnecessary... and might even be a bit... chilly!

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is A) Light the fire in the wood stove!

What an intriguing puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* You're small, about the size of 2 ants. This suggests that you're tiny, but not microscopic.
* You fly around parts of the world. This implies that you're capable of air travel, but you're not a living creature (since you're the size of ants).
* You're at a corner. This might be a metaphorical corner, or perhaps you're literally sitting on a corner of something.

Hmmm... Putting these clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you're a (C) stamp!

Here's my reasoning:

* Stamps are small, about the size of 2 ants. They're not tiny enough to be microscopic, but they're still compact.
* Stamps can fly around the world on letters and packages. While they don't have wings, they do travel through the air via transportation.
* And, what's a stamp sitting on? Ah, yes! A corner! Stamps are often stuck to corners of envelopes or packages.

Let's break it down, shall we?

"People enjoy me" - This could refer to something that brings people pleasure, excitement, or joy.

"Yet cry before me" - This could refer to something that, despite being enjoyable, also brings people to tears or evokes strong emotions.

With that in mind, let's explore the options:

(A) Date - While some people might enjoy a date, it's not typically something that makes people cry. Unless, of course, it's a breakup date...

(B) Become human - This option seems a bit far-fetched, but I suppose it's possible to imagine a scenario where someone becomes human and then cries about it. However, it's not a common or relatable scenario.

(C) Activity - This option could work, but it's a bit vague. What kind of activity would people enjoy and then cry about?

(D) Onion - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Onions can make people cry due to their irritating compounds, but it's not typically something people "enjoy" in the classical sense.

(E) Skin - This option seems a bit tricky, but could be interpreted as the skin of an onion (referencing the tears it brings on). However, it's a bit of a stretch.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (D) Onion!

A:
B A
What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I have legs but walk not": This suggests that whatever it is, it has legs, but it doesn't move on its own.
* "a strong back but work not": This implies that the object has a sturdy or robust back, but it's not meant for carrying or lifting heavy loads.
* "two good arms but reach not": This indicates that the object has arms, but they're not designed for grasping or extending to retrieve something.
* "a seat but sit and tarry not": This suggests that the object has a seat, but it's not meant for sitting or resting for an extended period.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

* (A) Store: A store has shelves and a back, but it doesn't have legs that walk. It's not a great fit.
* (B) Armchair: An armchair has a seat, arms, and a back, but it's designed for sitting and resting. It's a good possibility!
* (C) Relaxation: Relaxation is a concept, not an object, so it's not a viable answer.
* (D) Horseback: A horseback has legs, a back, and arms (of a rider), but it's not a stationary object. It's not a good fit.
* (E) Toilet seat: A toilet seat has a seat, but it's not designed for sitting or resting. It's also not a great fit.

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"A slender body" - This gives us a physical characteristic that can be applied to various objects.

"A tiny eye" - This is an interesting clue. Eyes are typically associated with vision, but a "tiny eye" could be interpreted in a more abstract sense.

"No matter what happens, I never cry" - Ah, this is where the magic happens! The phrase "I never cry" makes me think of emotions, specifically the lack of emotional response.

Now, let's put the pieces together...

Could the answer be... (D) fingernails?

Fingernails have a slender body (the nail itself), a tiny eye (the small opening at the base of the nail), and they don't cry (since they're inanimate objects). Plus, fingernails don't have the capacity to experience emotions, so they wouldn't cry even if they wanted to!

* "Filled with air and sometimes a gas" suggests something that contains air or a gas, perhaps in a confined space.
* "Tied to a string" implies that it's attached to something else, possibly for transportation or control.
* "Often seen on your birthday" is a clever hint, as it implies a connection to celebrations and festivities.

Hmmm... Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (B) balloon!

Why? Well, balloons are often filled with air or helium, which is a gas. They're often tied to a string or stick to be carried or controlled. And, who doesn't associate balloons with birthday celebrations? They're a classic party decoration and a symbol of joy and celebration!

Let's break it down:

* "I make your hands sweat" - This suggests that the thing being described has a physical effect on the person, causing a physical reaction.
* "and your heart cold" - This implies that the same thing is also affecting the person emotionally, causing a sense of unease or even fear.

Hmm... 

Could it be that the answer is related to a feeling or an emotion? Perhaps something that can evoke a strong physical and emotional response?

Let me take a guess... 

I think the correct answer is (A) fear!

Fear is known to cause physical symptoms like sweaty hands and a racing heart, which can be very unsettling and even paralyzing. It's an emotion that can make you feel like you're on edge, waiting for something to happen.

A:

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "My teeth are sharp" - This suggests that I have pointed or jagged edges, like a cutting tool.
* "My back is straight" - This implies that I have a straight or flat surface, which could be relevant to my purpose.
* "To cut things up it is my fate" - This indicates that I'm meant to cut or divide things, and it's my "destiny" or purpose.

Hmm... With these clues, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended!) and say that the correct answer is... (A) Chopper!

A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step and unravel the mystery.

First, let's focus on the colors: "I'm red, yellow, black and white." These colors are quite diverse, but one object that comes to mind that often features these colors is... a flag!

Next, let's examine the other clues:

* "Fish, flower, bird in flight": Ah, an interesting combination! Flags often feature symbols or emblems, and these could be connected to the colors mentioned earlier. For instance, a red fish, a yellow flower, and a black bird in flight could be part of a flag's design.
* "I'm underground and in the sky": This phrase makes me think of something that's omnipresent, yet can be found in both terrestrial and celestial environments. Hmm... What could that be?
* "Finger, hair, heart and eye": These words are quite diverse, but one connection that comes to mind is that they're all related to the human body. A finger is a part of the hand, hair is a feature of the head, the heart is a vital organ, and the eye is a sense organ.

Now, let's try to tie all these threads together! Based on the colors, the symbols, and the connection to the human body, I'm going to take a chance and propose that the answer is... (A) flame!

A flame is often depicted as red, yellow, black, and white, depending on its temperature and intensity. It can be found in both underground (e.g., volcanic activity) and in the sky (e.g., a burning star). The flame's shape can resemble a fish, a flower, or a bird in flight. And, if we stretch our imagination, a flame can be seen as a symbol for the heart, with its warmth and energy; or as an eye, with its intense light; or even as hair, with its flickering, dancing motion.

* "I have no hair" - Okay, so we're not dealing with a living creature with a furry coat, then.

* You wear a yellow sari, which is a traditional garment worn by women in South Asia.
* However, you have white children, which is an interesting twist.
* The options provided are all creative and playful, which hints that the answer might not be a straightforward one.

Hmm... Could it be that the answer is not a person, but an idea or a concept?

Let's break it down:

* "These" refers to something specific.
* "Knee-length" gives us a physical characteristic.
* "Formal wear" suggests a certain level of dressiness.
* "For men" narrows it down to a specific gender.
* "Popular in the highlands" hints at a geographic origin.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is... (D) kilt!

Why? Kilts are traditional garments worn by men in the Scottish Highlands, are knee-length, and are often worn as formal wear for special occasions.

Can you guess the correct answer? Answer Choices: (A) speak spanish (B) pickle (C) enlarge (D) pleasure (E) poison
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed break it down step by step.

First, I notice that each line has a dual effect: it describes two seemingly unrelated things that happen as a result of the mysterious force. This makes me think that the answer might not be a physical object, but rather an abstract concept.

Next, I observe that the effects described are often humorous or playful, like making guys have to pee or making celebrities look silly. This suggests that the answer might have a lighthearted or whimsical quality to it.

The phrase "If you squeeze me, I'll pop" and "If you look at me, you'll pop" is intriguing. It's possible that the answer is something that can be "popped" in a sense, like a balloon or a bubble.

The fact that 97% of Harvard graduates can't figure this out, but 84% of kindergarten students can, is a remarkable statistic. It makes me wonder if the answer is something that's more intuitive or accessible to younger minds.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Speak Spanish: This doesn't quite fit the bill, as it doesn't have the dual effects or whimsical qualities described in the riddle.

(B) Pickle: Ah, but what if the answer is something that can be used to make pickles... or something that's related to the process of pickling? This could be a clever connection to make!

(C) Enlarge: This doesn't seem to fit the tone or the effects described in the riddle.

(D)

A:
C C
What a delightful riddle! I'm excited to take a creative approach to solving this.

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said!

**When young, I am sweet in the sun.**

Hmm... "sweet" could refer to something pleasant, like a treat or a sensation. "In the sun" makes me think of warmth and happiness. Could it be something that's sweet and enjoyable when it's young and fresh, like a ripe fruit or a young flower?

**When middle-aged, I make you gay.**

Ahaha! "Make you gay" is an interesting phrase! Could it be something that adds joy or excitement to someone's life when they're middle-aged? Maybe it's something that's fun, lively, and playful?

**When old, I am valued more than ever.**

This one makes me think of something that becomes more precious or valuable with age, like a fine wine or a treasured possession.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the answer might be... (drumroll please)... a WINE BERRY!

Here's how it fits:

* When young (ripe), a wine berry is sweet and juicy, perfect for snacking or making wine.
* When middle-aged (mature), wine berries can be used to make wine, which can add joy and excitement to people's lives (think wine tastings or celebrations).
* When old (aged), wine berries become even more valuable, as the wine they produce can become more complex and nuanced over time, making it a treasured possession for wine enthusiasts.

A:
A C
What a thought-provoking riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I FLY BUT HAVE NO WINGS." - This suggests that whatever I am, it's able to move through the air or travel through space, but it doesn't have physical wings.
2. "I CRY BUT HAVE NO TEARS." - This is an intriguing one! It implies that whatever I am, it's capable of expressing emotions, perhaps even sorrow or despair, but it doesn't produce physical tears.
3. "I SEE DARKNESS COME UP ON THE WORLD." - This line hints that whatever I am, it's aware of changes or events that are unfolding on our planet, and these changes might be associated with darkness or negativity.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer might be... (drumroll please)... THE EARTH!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I FLY BUT HAVE NO WINGS": The Earth rotates on its axis, which can be seen as a form of "flying" or movement, but it doesn't have physical wings.
* "I CRY BUT HAVE NO TEARS": The Earth experiences natural disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires, which can be seen as a form of "crying" or expressing distress, but it doesn't produce physical tears.
* "I SEE DARKNESS COME UP ON THE WORLD": The Earth is often associated with darkness, particularly at night, and it's also a witness to the various negative changes and challenges that humanity faces.

Q: Tickle with your fingers and a song it will sing be careful, though, you may break a string what is it? Answer Choices: (A) fun (B) birdhouse (C) guitar (D) talking (E) strings
A:
C C
What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step:

1. "Tickle with your fingers" - This suggests a physical interaction, perhaps with a soft and delicate object.
2. "And a song it will sing" - This implies that the object is somehow connected to music, and the interaction with fingers will produce a musical response.
3. "Be careful, though, you may break a string" - Ah, now we have a warning! This tells us that the object is fragile and has a part that can be broken if not handled gently.

Putting these clues together, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (C) guitar!

The "song it will sing" refers to the musical sound produced when you strum or pluck a guitar string. The "tickling" action is a playful way to describe the gentle plucking of the strings. And, of course, the warning about breaking a string is a crucial reminder to handle the guitar with care, lest you snap one of those delicate strings!

Hmm... Air that is expelled orally...

I'm thinking... I'm thinking...

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The correct answer is... (B) burp!

Why? Well, a burp is the act of releasing air from the mouth, usually after consuming certain foods or drinks that can cause gas in the digestive system. It's a natural bodily function, and we all know what it feels like (or should I say, what it sounds like?).

It's not a donut (that's a tasty treat, but not a nut!), and it's not a rabbit burrow (those are cozy tunnels, but not nuts either!).

Could it be a jar? No, jars are usually containers, not nuts. And squirrels are cute, but they don't have holes, do they?

Wait a minute... what if we think about it in a more abstract way?

Could the answer be "entry"? Ah-ha! I think I've got it! 

You see, a nut can have an "entry" hole, like a hole in the center of a nut, where the stem or the shell meets the nut itself!

* "Come A Riddle Come A Raddle" - I think this might be a bit of a playful introduction, but it could also be hinting at the sound of a drumroll or a rhythmic pattern.
* "Come A Rat Tat Tat" - This could be the sound of a drumbeat, perhaps indicating a sense of urgency or importance.
* "A Wee Wee Man In A Red Red Hat" - Ah, a small person in a bright red hat! This might be a significant detail.
* "With A Staff In His Hand" - This suggests that our little red-hatted friend might be a wise or powerful individual.

* "You can see it everyday": This suggests that it's something that's visible to us, perhaps something we encounter regularly.
* "But cannot touch it at will": This implies that it's not something we can physically interact with whenever we want.

Hmm... Something we can see every day, but can't touch at will...

A:
B E
What an intriguing question!

To start, I'd like to interpret the phrases in a more metaphorical sense. Let's see...

* "A city that can't be seen" - Hmm, could it be a concept or an idea that's intangible, yet exists in the minds of people? Perhaps it's a metaphor for a collective consciousness or a cultural phenomenon that's not physically tangible.
* "A road that can't be driven on" - This might be a figurative path or a metaphorical journey that can't be taken literally. It could represent a difficult decision, a moral dilemma, or a personal growth experience that's not physical.
* "A building that you can't go into" - Ah, this one's interesting! Could it be a representation of a place that's not accessible, like a forbidden zone, a taboo topic, or an abstract concept that's not physically enterable?

With these interpretations in mind, I'd like to take a stab at the answer choices...

* (A) Earth - Not quite, as Earth is a physical entity that can be seen and explored.
* (B) Map - That's a clever idea, but a map is a physical representation of a location, not the location itself.
* (C) Noise - That's an interesting concept, but noise is more of an auditory phenomenon rather than a physical entity.
* (D) Iowa - Iowa is a state, but I don't see how it fits the bill.
* (E) Computer - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A computer is a device that can process abstract concepts and ideas, making it a fitting representation for the metaphors mentioned earlier.

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose... (E) Computer!

Am I correct?

If something "breaks" but isn't "breakable", it implies that it's not made of physical materials that can be shattered or fragmented in the classical sense. This means we're not talking about something like a vase, a glass, or a ceramic that can be broken by external forces.

Hmmm... What kind of "break" are we talking about here? Is it a metaphorical break?

Ah-ha! I think I have it!

(B) Man is the answer!

You see, a man's heart can "break" emotionally, but it's not a physical break. His heart can break due to sorrow, loss, or disappointment, but it can't be physically shattered like a vase. Am I right?

(A) start working... Hmm, that's a great start, but I'm not sure if it's the perfect fit.

(B) buy time... Ah-ha! That's an excellent choice! When we "use" you to "buy time", it implies that we're using you to pause, delay, or halt something, giving us a temporary reprieve.

(C) get away from... This option is interesting, but it's a bit more literal. We're not really "using" you to get away from something, are we?

(D) start running... That's a bit too hasty, don't you think? We're not looking to start a marathon just yet!

(E) brake break... Ah, now we're getting somewhere! When we "use" you to take a "brake break", we're taking a moment to pause, reflect, and recharge before moving forward.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down together, shall we?

1. "I'm not always around" - Hmm, this could mean that the answer is something that's not always present or visible.
2. "I'm big but I look small" - This phrase could be describing something that appears small but has a larger significance or impact.
3. "Many want to be called by my name" - This line suggests that the answer has a strong identity or reputation that others aspire to.
4. "And many are called by my name" - This part implies that the answer has a wide reach or is widely recognized.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each option:

(A) Geese: Geese can be small, but they're also part of a larger flock. While some geese may be named, it's not a universal desire. (Not the best fit.)

(B) Star: Stars can appear small in the night sky, but they're massive celestial bodies. Many people might want to be "stars" (famous or successful), but it's not a direct connection. (Not the best fit either.)

(C) Iny: I'm not familiar with "iny" being a name or a concept. Let's move on!

(D) Sleep all day: This option is intriguing, but it's not clear how it fits the other clues. (Not the most promising choice.)

Many people might want to be called by the name of a majestic bird (e.g., eagle, owl, or falcon). And, of course, many birds are called by their species names (e.g., robin, sparrow, or blue jay).

Forward, I am heavy... This suggests that when you spell out the word "forward" using individual letters, the first letter is "F", the second is "O", the third is "R", the fourth is "W", the fifth is "A", the sixth is "R", and the seventh is "D".

A:
E B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I can be all colours of the rainbow": This suggests that whatever we're looking for has the ability to change or take on different colors, like a rainbow.
* "Or have no colour at all": This implies that the answer could also be colorless or transparent.
* "Sometimes I'm empty, Sometimes I'm full": This part of the riddle hints that the answer could be something that can be empty or contain something, like a container.
* "What am I?": The final question leaves us wondering what this mysterious entity could be.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Wine: Wine can be colored (red, white, etc.) or clear (as in a sparkling wine), and it can be empty (if it's an empty bottle) or full (if it's a full bottle). This sounds like a great fit!

But, let's not stop there. We can think outside the box (pun intended!) and consider other possibilities...

(C) Rainbow: A rainbow is a spectrum of colors, but it can also be absent (no rainbows today, perhaps). However, a rainbow isn't typically something that can be "empty" or "full," so this might not be the best fit.

(D) Dark: While darkness can be described as "colorless," it's not typically associated with being "empty" or "full." Plus, darkness isn't something that can change colors like a rainbow.

(E) Glass: Glass can be any color, but it's often transparent or clear. It can be empty (like an empty glass vase) or full (like a filled glass). This could be a good contender!

So, based on our analysis, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (A) wine! What do you think?

Q: Many people throughout history love this alcoholic drink made from fermented grape juice Answer Choices: (A) club (B) community (C) bed (D) wine (E) jello
A:
D D
A delightful question!

Let's start by considering the phrase "fermented grape juice". That's a pretty strong hint about the type of drink we're looking for. And, let's be honest, fermented grape juice is quite a unique combination of words!

I think I can safely eliminate options A, B, and C, as they don't seem to fit the description. And, while jello is indeed a type of food made from gelatin, I'm pretty sure that's not what people mean when they talk about fermented grape juice

So, we're left with option D: wine. Ah, yes! Wine is indeed an alcoholic drink made from fermented grape juice. And, throughout history, many people have enjoyed it!

Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is (D) wine.

A:
B A
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "I always follow my brother": This suggests a close relationship with your brother.
* "although very different we are": This implies that you and your brother are distinct entities with different characteristics.
* "You can see him, but not me": This is an intriguing statement. It means that the person or entity talking about the brother can see the brother, but not the speaker themselves.
* "You can hear me, but not him": Another paradox! This means that the person or entity can hear the speaker, but not the brother.

Now, let's think creatively...

I propose an answer that's not among the options: Sound!

Think about it: Sound waves are invisible, so you can't see them. However, sound can be heard by humans and many other living beings. When you make a sound, you can hear yourself, but others can't hear your thoughts or inner workings.

In this scenario, the speaker (sound) always follows the brother (the source of the sound, e.g., a person speaking). The person or entity listening to the sound can see the speaker (the brother) making the sound, but not the sound itself. They can hear the sound, but not the thoughts or inner workings of the speaker.

So, what am I? I am Sound!

A:

What a delightful question!

Let's hop to it (pun intended)! Since the question mentions cute hares that hop and deliver eggs at Easter, I think we can safely assume that the nickname is related to Easter or the spring season.

Now, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

(A) Bunny: Ah-ha! This one seems like a strong contender! Bunnies are often associated with Easter, and they're known for their hopping ability. Plus, they're super cute!

(B) Wolf: Hmm... not so sure about this one. Wolves aren't typically associated with Easter or delivering eggs. And they're not exactly known for their cuteness.

(C) Cornpone: This one's a bit of a stretch, don't you think? Cornpone is a type of cornmeal mush, and it doesn't seem to have any connection to Easter or hopping hares.

(D) Ingredient: This one's a bit too vague for my taste. Ingredients are, well, ingredients – not exactly a nickname for a cute hare.

(E) Lamb: Lamb's are often associated with Easter, but they're not typically known for hopping or delivering eggs. And while they can be cute, they're not exactly the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Easter bunnies.

So, after careful consideration, I'm going to take a hop (again, pun intended!) and say that the correct answer is...

(A) Bunny!

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "It's seen in yellow, blue, and red": This suggests that the answer is something that can be perceived or observed in different colors. Hmm...
* "and defines what's black or white": This implies that the answer is related to contrast, possibly something that creates a visual distinction between two extremes.
* "Opposite to heavy but can't be lifted": This is an intriguing phrase. If something is the opposite of heavy, it's likely to be light or weightless. But if it can't be lifted, that means it's probably not a physical object that can be picked up.
* "it makes itself scarce by night": This line hints that the answer might be something that changes or behaves differently during the day vs. night.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a leap of creative imagination...

Could the answer be... LIGHT?

Light can be seen in different colors (yellow, blue, red), it defines what's black or white (by creating contrast), it's the opposite of heavy (weightless), yet it can't be lifted (it's an intangible phenomenon). And, of course, light makes itself scarce by night, as it's less intense and more scattered during this time.

What a delightful riddle!

Let's fill in the blanks and see where it takes us...

"Fill my bucket" - Ah, a container that can be filled!

"Spill my bucket" - Ah, and then emptied again!

"Over a plane of snow" - Ah, a cold and wintery scene!

Hmmm... Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think I am... (drumroll please)... a SNOWSHOE!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Fill my bucket" refers to the snowshoe's basket-like design that can be filled with snow as you walk.
* "Spill my bucket" refers to the way the snow can spill out from the basket as you move.
* "Over a plane of snow" refers to the snowshoe's purpose: to traverse snowy terrain.
* "Black the track as I look back" refers to the way snowshoes can leave a dark trail in the snow behind you.
* "My footsteps talk but make no sound" refers to the muffled sound of snowshoes on snow, making it seem as if your footsteps aren't making any noise!

A:
A B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed break it down step by step.

"He who makes it does not keep it." This line suggests that the creator or producer of the thing does not retain possession of it. This could imply that the maker of this thing has no control over its fate once it's created.

"He who takes it does not know it." This line implies that the one who receives or takes the thing has no understanding or awareness of its true nature. It's as if they're not privy to the secrets or implications of what they've acquired.

"He who knows it does not want it." This line is intriguing! It suggests that those who have knowledge or insight about the thing actually desire to distance themselves from it or avoid it. Perhaps the thing is too complex, difficult, or burdensome to handle.

"He who gathers it must destroy it." This final line is a crucial piece of the puzzle. It implies that the one who accumulates or aggregates this thing must ultimately eliminate or obliterate it. This could be due to its inherent nature or the consequences of its accumulation.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a bold leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill: (B) decay!

Here's my reasoning:

* "He who makes it does not keep it" could refer to the fact that decay is a natural process that affects all things, and the creator or producer of an object doesn't have control over its eventual decay.
* "He who takes it does not know it" might suggest that those who acquire something or inherit it don't fully comprehend the implications of its decay or the consequences of its eventual destruction.
* "He who knows it does not want it" could imply that those who are aware of the inevitability of decay might desire to avoid or distance themselves from the process, perhaps because it's a painful or unsettling realization.
* "He who gathers it must destroy it" might refer to the fact that decay is a natural process that

"Face like a tree" makes me imagine a face with a rugged, bark-like texture. "Skin like the sea" conjures up an image of smooth, shimmering scales. And "a great beast I may be" suggests something powerful and majestic.

The phrase "yet vermin frighten me" is an interesting twist. Vermin are small, pesky creatures that might not be a threat to a great beast. This could imply that the beast has a vulnerability or a fear.

* "But not in the morning" suggests that this "head" disappears or changes somehow before morning arrives.

Could it be that the "head" is a... HEAD OF HAIR?!

At night, we sleep with our heads on our pillows, and our hair is "at our head" (so to speak). But in the morning, we wake up, brush our hair, and style it - effectively making the "head" (our hair) disappear... or at least change significantly!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed break it down step by step. You've given us a series of contradictions, and I love it!

Firstly, you mention that you can:

1. Break buildings
2. Make things rust
3. Destroy the earth

These actions suggest that you have a significant impact on the physical world. However, you also claim that:

4. You're not a thing you can touch, see, hear, smell, or taste

This creates an interesting paradox. You're affecting the physical world, but you're intangible.

Hmmm... My mind is racing with possibilities!

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer might be (D) Time.

Here's my reasoning:

* You can break buildings, make things rust, and destroy the earth, which are all actions that occur over a period of time.
* You're not a thing you can touch, see, hear, smell, or taste because time is an abstract concept, not a physical entity.
* Time is often referred to as the "enemy" of physical structures, as it can cause them to decay and deteriorate.
* Finally, time is the ultimate separator of past, present, and future, which aligns with option (E) separation.

* Outside is indeed a space without physical walls, but it's a bit too broad of an answer.
* A bathroom doesn't typically have walls in the classical sense, but it still has physical barriers (walls) to define its space.
* Lichen is a type of fungus-algae partnership, and while it doesn't have physical walls, it's not a room either.
* Prison is a great answer, but it's not the only option.

A:
D D
What a delightfully eerie riddle! Let's dive into the darkness and uncover the answer.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "I await the fall of night" - This suggests that whatever it is, it's active at night, and perhaps it's not fond of the light.
2. "To give my victims a painful bite" - Ah, the classic vampire trope! This implies that our culprit is something that inflicts harm on others, likely through a physical interaction.
3. "But I hide when light's avast" - This phrase is quite poetic, but it essentially says that whatever it is, it's forced to retreat when light is present. This reinforces the idea that our culprit doesn't like the light.
4. "The darknesses clutches hold me fast" - This final line suggests that our culprit is somehow bound to or trapped by the darkness.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

A. Rooster: While roosters do crow at night, they're not typically associated with biting or inflicting pain. Roosters also aren't usually afraid of light.

B. Hair: Hair isn't typically associated with biting or causing pain. It's also not bound to darkness.

C. Coat: A coat isn't capable of biting or inflicting pain. It's also not inherently afraid of light.

D. Vampire: Ah, the vampire! This is a great fit. Vampires are often depicted as being weakened by sunlight and are active at night. They also bite their victims, causing harm. The phrase "The darknesses clutches hold me fast" could be interpreted as the vampire's need for the cover of darkness to survive.

E. Neck: While a neck can be bitten, it's not typically associated with inflicting pain or being bound to darkness.

Given the cumulative evidence, I'm going to take a stab (pun intended) and say that the correct answer is... (D) vampire!

* "What lion can not roar..."
This already tells us that we're not looking for a literal lion, but rather a lion-related answer.
* "...and can't move"

Hmmm...

The correct answer is (B) Sphinx!

A sphinx is a mythological creature that's often depicted with the body of a lion, but it's not a real lion. And, of course, a sphinx can't roar (it's a silent statue-like creature) and can't move on its own (it's stationary).

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step...

"32 white horses on a red hill" - This gives me a vivid image of a beautiful, majestic scene. Horses are often associated with grandeur and beauty, so I'm thinking of something that would require a grand setting.

"First Chomping, then stomping" - Ah, this is where things get interesting! Chomping and stomping are actions typically associated with eating or movement, respectively. I'm thinking of something that would involve a sudden burst of activity or energy.

"Then standing still" - And finally, after all that commotion, we have a sense of stillness and calm. This is where I think we might be looking at a moment of completion or rest.

Now, let's put all these steps together... I think I have it!

The answer is... a TEA SET!

Here's my reasoning:

* "32 white horses on a red hill" refers to the 32 teaspoons (the "horses") on a tea set, sitting on a red tea cozy or a red tablecloth.
* "First Chomping, then stomping" refers to the act of taking a sip of tea (the "chomping") and then placing the cup down (the "stomping") - a gentle, deliberate action.
* "Then standing still" refers to the tea set, now complete and still on the table, waiting for its next use.

A:
A A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

As the man walks in the pouring rain, his umbrella is full of holes, which means it's not doing much to keep him dry. And to make matters worse, he's not even using his hood! 

But, wait a minute... what if we focus on the fact that he's walking in the pouring rain, and not on the umbrella or the hood?

Could it be that the rain is not just any ordinary rain? What if it's a special kind of rain that only affects the umbrella and the hood, but leaves the man's hair completely untouched?

I'm going to take a wild guess here... What if the man is walking in a rain of cotton candy? 

In that case, the holes in the umbrella would just be sucked up by the sweet, fluffy rain, and the man's hair would remain completely dry!

So, my answer is... none of the above!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested:

Hmmm... 

I think I can make a connection! What if the answer is a "dictionary"? 

In a dictionary, words are organized in alphabetical order. Yesterday follows today because words that start with "y" come after words that start with "t" (like "today"). And tomorrow, with its "t" and "o" sounds, is right in the middle of this sequence!

Q: How many times does the long hand of the clock pass the short hand between midnight one day and midnight the following day? As both hands are together at the starting time of midnight this does not count as a pass.  Answer Choices: (A) grass (B) morse code (C) 21 (D) snub (E) earth
A:
C A
What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step, but also think outside the box!

The short hand (hour hand) moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour. The long hand (minute hand) moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute.

Now, let's imagine a dance between these two hands. When the long hand passes the short hand, it's like a little waltz. The long hand is always trying to catch up with the short hand, but it's like trying to catch a slippery fish!

As the clock strikes 12, the long hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the short hand is also at the 12 o'clock position. As the clock moves forward, the long hand starts to move away from the short hand, but it's like they're doing a little "pas de deux" – they're moving together, but not quite touching.

As the hours pass, the long hand moves 30 degrees per hour, and the short hand moves 6 degrees per minute. This means that the long hand will move 5 times as far as the short hand in one hour. So, in one hour, the long hand will pass the short hand 5 times.

Since there are 24 hours between midnight one day and midnight the following day, the long hand will pass the short hand 24 x 5 = 120 times!

But wait, we need to subtract the starting position, where both hands are together at midnight. So, we subtract 1 from the total count. Therefore, the correct answer is... (C) 21!

Now, go ahead and give me a high-five for this creative solution!

Q: As I went across the bridge, I met a man with a load of wood which was neither straight nor crooked.  What kind of wood was it? Answer Choices: (A) metal (B) ship's hold (C) sawdust (D) wooden leg (E) burning
A:
C B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, we know the man is carrying a load of wood. That's a given. Then, we're told that the wood is "neither straight nor crooked." This is where things get interesting!

If the wood were straight, it would mean it's uniform and lacks any twists or turns. But if it were crooked, it would mean it's irregular and has some sort of curvature.

So, what if the wood is neither straight nor crooked? That means it's... (drumroll please)... circular!

Ah-ha! The answer is not a type of wood at all! The correct answer is actually (B) "ship's hold". A ship's hold is a compartment on a ship that stores cargo, and in this case, the "load of wood" refers to the wooden planks or timbers that make up the ship's hull!

Was that a clever explanation?

Q: I can trap many different things and colors, ever changing, not boring look closely and you may find yourself also caught in my trap Answer Choices: (A) mirror (B) trap reel (C) deadly (D) trapdoor (E) kettlebell
A:
A A
What a fascinating question!

Let's start by analyzing the clues:

* "I can trap many different things and colors" - This suggests that the answer is something that can capture or hold various objects or hues.
* "Ever changing" - This implies that the answer is dynamic, adaptable, or capable of shifting forms or appearances.
* "Not boring" - This is a subjective term, but it might indicate that the answer has an interesting or captivating quality.
* "Look closely and you may find yourself also caught in my trap" - This phrase implies that the answer is somehow mesmerizing or alluring, and could potentially ensnare or enthrall the observer.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious: (A) mirror!

Here's my reasoning:

* A mirror can "trap" reflections of various objects, colors, and even people, making it a fitting candidate for the "trapping many different things and colors" description.
* The ever-changing aspect could refer to the way a mirror reflects different scenes, objects, and people at different times, making it a dynamic and adaptable entity.
* Mirrors can be captivating and alluring, often used in art, design, and even magic tricks to create an illusion of depth or infinity. It's possible that someone could become so enthralled by their own reflection in a mirror that they feel "caught" or entranced.
* Finally, the phrase "look closely and you may find yourself also caught in my trap" could be interpreted as a play on words, as the mirror's reflection can literally trap one's gaze, making it difficult to look away.

Q: You get many of me, but never enough after the last one, your life soon will snuff you may have one of me but one day a year, when the last one is gone, your life disappears Answer Choices: (A) perspective (B) birthday (C) drowsiness (D) calendar (E) boat
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "You get many of me, but never enough after the last one" - This suggests that there's a finite quantity of something that's plentiful at first, but then it becomes scarce after a certain point.
* "your life soon will snuff you" - This implies that something related to the first point is closely tied to one's life or existence.
* "may have one of me but one day a year" - This hint suggests that there might be a specific day or occasion when one gets a chance to have this thing.
* "when the last one is gone, your life disappears" - This final part implies that if the scarce quantity of the thing runs out, one's life itself comes to an end.

Now, let's examine each option:

(A) Perspective: This doesn't quite fit, as perspective isn't something that's limited in quantity or closely tied to one's life.

(B) Birthday: Ah, but birthdays fit the bill perfectly! You get many birthdays, but after the last one (your last birthday on earth), you'll never have another. On your birthday, you may have a celebration or a special day, which is the "one day a year" mentioned. And if you've had your last birthday, your life has essentially "disappeared."

(C) Drowsiness: This option doesn't quite match the description, as drowsiness isn't something that's limited in quantity or closely tied to one's existence.

(D) Calendar: This is an intriguing option, but calendars aren't directly tied to one's life or existence.

(E) Boat: This one seems unlikely, as boats aren't typically associated with a finite quantity or a specific day of the year.

So, based on the hints and the fits, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (B) Birthday!

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Alive without breath" - This tells me that the answer is something that doesn't need oxygen to survive.
* "s cold as death" - This phrase suggests that the answer is something that is very cold, almost to the point of being lifeless.
* "thinks a fountain is a puff of air" - This is a clever clue! Fountains are typically associated with water, but the answer is thinking of a fountain as a gentle breeze or a puff of air. This makes me wonder if the answer is something that is typically associated with water, but is being described in a more abstract way.

You can hear me, which means you're referring to something that produces sound. That's a great starting point!

You can control me, which implies that you have some influence over this entity's behavior or actions. This adds another layer of intrigue!

* "Warns of deflating tires" suggests that the answer is related to warning of a potential problem with tires.
* "And serpents" adds a fascinating twist - what does this have to do with warning about tires?

Hmmm... I think I have it!

Since "serpents" can be associated with snakes, which are known to hiss, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is... (D) hiss!

When a tire is deflating, you might hear a hissing sound, which could be a warning sign that the tire is losing air. And, as a clever aside, snakes are also known for hissing when threatened or alarmed!

Q: What goes in hard and comes out wet and gooey? Answer Choices: (A) gum (B) handshake (C) paint (D) rub (E) govenor
A:
A A
What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

First, we know that the answer is something that goes IN hard. That means it starts in a solid state, perhaps with a rigid or stiff form.

Next, we know that it COMES OUT wet and gooey. This suggests that it undergoes a transformation, perhaps a change in its physical state, resulting in a liquid or semi-liquid consistency.

Now, let's examine each answer choice:

(A) Gum: Ah, but gum doesn't really go in hard, does it? It's usually soft and chewy to begin with.

(B) Handshake: A handshake isn't something that goes in hard or comes out wet and gooey. It's more of a social gesture!

(C) Paint: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Paint can definitely go in hard (in its dried, solid form) and come out wet and gooey when it's mixed with water or solvent. But is this the only possible answer?

(D) Rub: A rub, as in a massage or a gentle stroking, isn't something that has a clear "hard" or "wet and gooey" outcome.

(E) Governor: A governor, as in a political officeholder, doesn't really fit the description either.

And then it hits me... What if we're thinking outside the box (pun intended)? What if the answer is something that's not a physical object at all, but rather an experience or an action?

In that case, I propose a new answer: a kiss! When you give someone a kiss, it's often a hard, firm action, but the outcome is a wet and gooey smooch!

Answer Choices: (A) climb stairs (B) age (C) motivation (D) pain (E) bills
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

**I change peoples appearances and thoughts.** This suggests that the answer is something that has a profound impact on how people look or feel about themselves.

**If a person takes care of them self I will go up even higher.** This implies that the answer is something that improves or increases with self-care or effort.

**To some people I will fool them.** This hints that the answer might be something that can be misleading or deceptive to some individuals.

**To others I am a mystery.** This suggests that the answer is something that can be difficult to understand or grasp, even for those who are aware of its presence.

**Some people might want to try and hide me but I will show.** This implies that the answer is something that cannot be concealed or hidden, even if someone tries to deny its existence.

**No matter how hard people try I will Never go down.** This is a crucial clue, as it suggests that the answer is something that is irreversible or progressive.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark...

**I think the answer is (B) age!**

Age changes people's appearances and thoughts, as they grow older and gain more life experience. Taking care of oneself can lead to a longer and healthier life, which can be a blessing or a curse, depending on one's perspective. Some people might try to hide their age or pretend to be younger than they are, but ultimately, age will always show. And, of course, age is a one-way journey - it will never go down or reverse itself.

* "Four wheels": This suggests that whatever it is, it has a physical presence and is capable of movement.
* "And flies": This adds an interesting twist. Flies are attracted to things that are, shall we say, "unpleasant" or "decaying". This makes me wonder if the answer is something that might be associated with, well, a bit of a stink!

Hmmm... With that in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say... (drumroll please)... (C) brake drum!

Here's my reasoning: Brake drums can be a bit grimy and grubby, and they're often located in areas where the air might not be the freshest. Who knows, maybe there's a fly or two buzzing around a brake drum on a hot summer day? It's a stretch, I know, but I'm feeling adventurous today!

What a delightfully ominous and poetic passage!

Let's indeed think step by step...

The speaker is saying they've been waiting their whole life to kiss someone, and when they do, they'll make sure that person's face is veiled from the world forevermore. This implies a permanent change or concealment.

(A) Entering school doesn't quite fit the bill, as it's not about a single, permanent act.

(B) Death is a strong contender, as it would indeed veil someone's face from the world forevermore. But the tone of the passage doesn't scream "mortality" to me.

(C) Life vest isn't relevant here, as it's not a means to conceal or change someone's appearance.

(D) Makeup could be a possibility, as it can change or veil someone's appearance. But it's not the most straightforward answer.

(E) Lips, while relevant, isn't the correct answer, as it's not the thing that will be veiling someone's face.

I love a good puzzle! Let's dive into it!

At first glance, it seems like a simple question, but there might be a clever twist to it. Let's analyze each option:

(A) Air: Hmm, air is made up of gases, and it doesn't have a surface that can get wet. That's a good start!

(B) Bucket: A bucket is a container that can indeed get wet if it's left outside in the rain. So, this option is unlikely.

(C) Sea: Ah, the sea is already wet, so even if it rains, it won't get any wetter. That's a nice connection, but I think there's something more clever at play here.

(D) Talk: Talk is a form of communication, and it's not a physical entity that can get wet. That's an interesting approach, but I'm not convinced it's the correct answer.

(E) Countryside: The countryside is a general term for the rural areas, and it's not a specific object that can get wet. That's an interesting option, but it might be too vague.

After considering each option, I'm going to take a step back and think about the question in a more abstract sense. What never gets wetter, no matter how much it rains? That's when it hit me!

The correct answer is (A) air! Air is an invisible gas that surrounds us, and it doesn't have a physical surface that can get wet. No matter how much it rains, the air remains dry. It's a clever play on words, and I'm glad I was able to follow the logic to arrive at the correct answer!

Hmm... what has leaves, but isn't a tree?

First, I'd rule out the obvious options like trees, parks, and oxygen (although oxygen does have leaves, like molecules, but that's a stretch!).

Now, let's consider our answer choices:

* Tangerine: Ah, citrus fruits! And tangerines do have leaves, don't they? But what kind of leaves? The peel of a tangerine is not exactly like the leaves we'd find on a tree... unless... unless we're thinking outside the box!

What if we're not talking about a physical leaf, but a figurative one? Perhaps a tangerine has "leaves" in the sense that it has segments, or slices, that resemble leaves?

* Orange: Ah, another citrus fruit! And oranges do have leaves, just like tangerines! But, again, we're not talking about physical leaves, are we? What if we're thinking about the "leaves" of a book? Orange you glad I'm taking a creative approach?

* Table: Hmm... a table? What kind of leaves would a table have? Ah, but what if we're thinking about the leaves of a table, like the flat surface where we place our books, papers, or... leaves?

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

"We caught, we threw away" - This implies that we caught something, but then got rid of it.

"We kept what we didn't catch" - Ah, but what if we didn't catch anything? That would mean we kept... nothing!

But wait, what if we're not talking about physical objects or living things? What if we're talking about an abstract concept?

In that case, "we caught" could mean we attempted to grasp or understand something, and "we threw away" could mean we let go of it because we failed to comprehend it.

So, if we didn't catch anything, what did we keep? We kept the idea or concept itself! We didn't grasp it, but we still held onto the notion or concept.

Hmmm... Which answer choice fits this abstract interpretation?

Ah-ha! I think it's (D) heliotropism! Heliotropism is the concept or phenomenon of plants turning towards the sun. We might attempt to understand or "catch" the behavior, but we wouldn't be able to "catch" the plants themselves. We'd keep the idea or concept of heliotropism, even if we didn't fully grasp it.

A:
B C
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, I love the paradoxical tone of the riddle - "You get many of me, but never enough" and "After the last one, your life soon will snuff" already hint at a clever play on words.

From the first line, I'm guessing that "you" refers to something that can be obtained or acquired, but never in sufficient quantity.

The second line suggests that once all of "it" is gone, something catastrophic happens to the person's life. This is where I start to think about things that have a finite lifespan or a limited availability.

The third line provides a crucial hint: "You may have one of me but one day a year". This implies that there's a specific occasion or event when this thing can be obtained or experienced.

And finally, the fourth line reinforces the idea that once all of "it" is gone, something terrible happens to the person's life.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended).

I think the answer is... (C) CANDLE!

Here's my reasoning:

* You get many candles, but never enough to last forever.
* After the last candle is gone, the birthday person's life (or the celebration) soon comes to an end.
* You may have one candle on your birthday, but it's only lit for a day a year.
* And once all the candles are blown out, the birthday magic disappears!

* "Travels all around the world": This suggests that the answer is moving from one place to another, covering a vast distance.

Hmmm... This is where things get interesting!

I'm going to take a chance and propose a creative solution: What if the answer is a "postage stamp"?

Here's my reasoning:

* A postage stamp travels all around the world on letters and packages, covering a vast distance.
* Yet, it stays in the same place – on the envelope or package – even as it travels to different parts of the globe. It's a small, stationary object that accompanies the mail as it moves from one location to another.

Q: We dwell in cottages of straw, and labor much for little gains; sweet food from us our masters draw, and then with death reward our pains Answer Choices: (A) straw hat (B) bees (C) straw bales (D) being (E) gnome
A:
B A
What a delightful riddle! Let's unravel the mystery together.

The poem mentions "cottages of straw", which immediately makes me think of the classic story of Hansel and Gretel. The wicked witch in the story builds a house made of gingerbread and candy, but Hansel and Gretel find a house made of straw, sticks, and bricks.

The next line says "and labor much for little gains". This makes me think of the witch's intentions - she lures children to her house with sweet treats, only to trap them and eat them. The "masters" in this case could be the witch, who draws "sweet food" (i.e., the children's innocence and life) from the children, and then "with death reward our pains" (i.e., by devouring them).

So, considering these clues, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (B) bees!

Am I buzzing with excitement because I think I'm right?

What a delightful question!

Let's start by breaking it down, shall we?

"What has a ring..." - Ah, a ring! That usually makes me think of a circular shape, like a wedding ring or a ring in a bell.

"But no fingers..." - Hmm, that's an interesting twist! Fingers are typically associated with hands, so if it doesn't have fingers, it must be something that has a ring but isn't a hand.

After considering all the options, I'm going to take a chance and say... (drumroll please)... (A) sign!

A sign can have a ring to it, like a ring-shaped sign or a sign that has a circular shape. But, of course, a sign doesn't have fingers! What do you think? Am I on the right track?

A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. Here's my take:

* "I beautify the world" suggests that the answer is something that enhances or makes the world more attractive.
* "I rid shadow's doubt" implies that the answer is able to dispel uncertainty or darkness.
* "The blind ones yearn" and "Sleepy ones shout" seem to be contrasting statements, but together they might indicate that the answer is something that has a profound impact on those who are unable to see or are lacking in awareness.
* "The watchman's friend" could be hinting that the answer is something that is closely related to protection or vigilance.
* "A guide to commend" suggests that the answer is something that is praised or appreciated for its guidance.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer is... (drumroll please)... "light"!

Here's my reasoning:

* Light beautifies the world by illuminating it and making it more vibrant.
* Light rids shadows' doubt by dispelling darkness and uncertainty.
* Blind people yearn for light, as it is essential for their daily lives. Sleepy people might shout with joy when they're exposed to sunlight, which can be a powerful wake-up call.
* Watchmen and guides often rely on light to perform their duties, whether it's to spot potential threats or to lead others through the dark.
* Light is often commended for its ability to guide us and illuminate our path.

Of course, I could be entirely wrong, but I hope my creative interpretation has been... enlightening!

Q: loser are green but i am yellow what am???? Answer Choices: (A) pigment (B) bee hive (C) bee (D) lizard (E) yellow person
A:
C A
What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* Losers are green, which is an interesting and unexpected statement. Perhaps it's a metaphorical or figurative connection rather than a literal one?
* You, on the other hand, are yellow. This suggests that we're not dealing with physical characteristics, but rather a comparison or a play on words.

Hmmm... Given that "losers are green," I'd venture to say that the connection is not about the color itself, but rather about the concept or feeling associated with being a "loser." Perhaps being a "loser" is often accompanied by feelings of sadness or disappointment, which can be represented by the color green (think of green as a symbol of envy or jealousy, for instance).

With that in mind, if you're yellow, it could imply that you're the opposite of a "loser" – you're successful, optimistic, or maybe even happy! 

Considering the answer choices, I'd say that (E) Yellow Person is the most fitting option. Am I correct, or would you like me to think outside the box some more?

Tell me for I don't know, what is my identity? Answer Choices: (A) expression (B) disappear (C) explode (D) appear suddenly (E) darkness
A:
E B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's unravel the mystery together.

Firstly, you can fill up any space in an instant, and you can fill up a room with a flip of the switch. This suggests that you're something that can be turned on or off, and you're capable of occupying a large area.

The next line, "With a flip of the switch you can hide in me," implies that you can conceal or obscure something. This is reinforced by the phrase "With another flip you are revealed and I disappear," which indicates that you can be turned on to reveal something, and then turned off to disappear.

The statement "I am the opposite of all things nice" gives us a hint that you might not be a pleasant or desirable thing.

Finally, "And tend to shelter people when they don't want to be found" suggests that you might provide a sense of safety or protection, but only for those who want to remain hidden or anonymous.

Taking all these clues into consideration, I think I can make an educated guess about your identity...

Are you... (E) darkness?

As darkness, you can fill up a room by blocking out the light, and you can be turned on or off by closing or opening the curtains, for instance. You can hide things or people from view, and you can provide a sense of shelter or protection for those who want to remain hidden. And, of course, darkness is often the opposite of light, which is typically considered a nice or pleasant thing.

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I have a long tongue" - This could refer to something that has a long, slender shape or a flexible structure that can extend or stretch out.
* "and when I am needed they use me" - This suggests that whatever we're thinking of is often called upon when needed, and is used to achieve a specific purpose.
* "I am a protector for getting hurt" - This implies that this thing is meant to prevent or mitigate harm or damage in some way.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Fish market - Unlikely, as a fish market isn't typically associated with a long tongue or protection from harm.
B. Gravel - Also unlikely, as gravel isn't typically thought of as having a tongue or serving as a protector.
C. Coast - This might be a possibility, as a coast can be thought of as a "tongue" of land extending into the sea, and it can provide protection from the harsh conditions of the ocean. However, it's not the most obvious fit.
D. Bridge - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A bridge can be thought of as having a "tongue" of structure that spans a gap or body of water, and it's often used to protect people and vehicles from harm by providing a safe and stable crossing point.
E. Taste buds - Unlikely, as taste buds aren't typically thought of as having a long tongue or serving as a protector from harm.

Taking all these factors into account, I think the most creative and fitting answer is... (drumroll please)... D. Bridge!

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the mystery together.

You can slash but have no knife. Hmm... What can slash without a physical knife? Ah-ha! I think I can make a cut with my answer: a musical note! A slash symbol (/) is often used to represent a musical note. Am I on the right track?

You can dash but have no legs. Interesting! In this case, I'm going to take a chance and think about movement. A dash can refer to a sudden movement or a short distance. Could it be that the answer is speed or velocity? Perhaps something that can move quickly, but doesn't have physical legs?

You can pound but have no hammer. This one's a toughie! But I'm thinking about sounds and rhythms. A pound can refer to a drumbeat or a strong, repeated sound. Could it be that the answer is music again? Maybe something that can create a pounding rhythm without a physical hammer?

You can star but have no stage. Ah, now we're getting to the final piece of the puzzle! A star can refer to a shining object in the sky, but it could also be a rating or a symbol of excellence. In this case, I think the answer might be related to performance or recognition. Could it be that the answer is a review or a critique? Something that can give a "star" rating without being on a physical stage?

With all these clues combined, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose... (E) musician! A musician can slash through notes, dash through rhythms, pound out beats, and star with their performance, all without needing a physical knife, legs, hammer, or stage. What do you think?

As I ponder the options, I start to imagine a person trying to be extremely careful in their daily life. They're double-checking their surroundings, making sure not to trip or bump into anything. They're paying attention to the road signs, not speeding, and being mindful of the weather.

And then it hits me - what if, despite their best efforts, they're still overlooking something crucial? Something that's right under their... (drumroll please)... nose!

That's right, I'm going with option (C) nose! We tend to overlook the obvious, even when we're trying to be careful. Our sense of smell is closely tied to our emotions and memories, and we often take it for granted. We might be too distracted to notice the subtlest scents, like the aroma of freshly brewed coffee or the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers.

So, the correct answer is indeed (C) nose! What do you think? Did I sniff out the correct answer?

A:
A B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The riddle states that "they are fetched in the dark with no call," which implies that whatever "they" are, they are obtained or taken without any prior notice or invitation. This could happen when we're in a state of darkness, both literally and figuratively.

On the other hand, "they are taken in the light without being stolen" suggests that when we're in a state of clarity or awareness (i.e., in the light), we're able to take or receive these "things" freely and without any sense of theft or loss.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Stars: While stars are indeed beautiful and can be seen in the light of night, it's a bit of a stretch to imagine them being "fetched" in the dark. Plus, how would we take them without being stolen?

(B) Blue: Hmm, not sure how blue fits the description. Blue is a color, and it's not something that can be fetched or taken in the dark or light.

(C) Message: This is an interesting choice! A message could be fetched in the dark (e.g., through intuition or instinct), and it could be taken in the light (e.g., when we understand its meaning). But would a message really be stolen?

(D) Sunlight: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Sunlight is something that can be fetched in the dark (i.e., through the process of daybreak), and it can be taken without being stolen (since it's freely available to all). This could be a possible answer!

(E) Room: A room is a physical space, and it doesn't quite fit the description. While we could enter a room in the dark or light, it's not something that can be fetched or taken.

Based on this analysis, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is (D) Sunlight! What do you think?

Now, let's take a closer look at the remaining options: woodcock, wood pile, and... wait a minute! A wood pile is made of wood, but we can't saw it because it's already a pile! It's not a single piece of wood that can be cut.

A:
A B
What a clever riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I have four wings but cannot fly": This suggests that the object has a structure or design that resembles wings, but it's not meant for flight.
2. "Never laugh and never cry": This implies that the object is inanimate and doesn't have emotions.
3. "You can spot me on the same place as before": This hint suggests that the object is stationary and doesn't move around.
4. "I'm always found tailing away with a little sound": This phrase is where things get interesting! "Tailing away" could mean that the object has a trailing or flowing aspect to it, and the "little sound" might be a clue to its nature.

With these clues in mind, I'd like to propose a creative solution:

What if the answer is an "Air Ventilation System" (Option E, Tailwind)?

Here's how it fits the description:
	* "Four wings" could refer to the four air vents or blades that are part of the system.
	* "Cannot fly" makes sense, as air vents aren't designed for flight.
	* "Never laugh and never cry" is accurate, as air vents are inanimate and don't have emotions.
	* "Same place as before" implies that the air vents are stationary and remain in the same location.
	* "Tailing away with a little sound" could describe the gentle hum or whirring noise that an air ventilation system might make as it operates, with the "tailing away" referring to the airflow being directed out of the vents.

What do you think? Does this creative solution fly with you, or would you like to explore other options?

* "These" refers to something that makes grown men do something.
* "make grown men dance" is the action that's happening.
* "in end zones" gives us a hint about the context - we're likely talking about American football!

Now, let's think about what could be the answer choice that fits this scenario. I'm going to take a wild guess... 

Could it be... (B) touchdown?

When a team scores a touchdown, the players on the team celebrating in the end zone often do a fun dance, like the "Ickey Shuffle" or the "Floss". It's a way for them to express their excitement and joy after a big play. And, it's not uncommon to see grown men (players, coaches, and even fans!) dancing in the end zone after a touchdown!

A:
B A
What a intriguing question! Let's embark on a thrilling adventure to uncover the answer.

First, let's acknowledge that God and the Devil are often considered archetypes, representing opposing forces in the universe. God is often associated with goodness, light, and creation, while the Devil is associated with evil, darkness, and destruction.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

A) Satan: Ah, the fallen angel, often seen as the embodiment of evil. While Satan is indeed evil, I think we can do better than that.

B) Hi: Ah, a friendly greeting, but not quite the answer we're looking for.

C) Cotton: An interesting choice, but I'm not sure how cotton fits into this equation.

D) Behemoth: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Behemoth is a biblical giant, often associated with chaos and destruction. This is a good start, but I think we can find something even more intriguing.

E) Control: Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter! Control is the ability to manipulate and dominate, often at the expense of others. This is where things start to get interesting.

So, what is greater than God and eviler than the Devil? Let's think outside the box and consider the ultimate power: Time.

Time is greater than God because it predates the concept of a divine being, and it is more omnipresent than any deity. Time is the fabric that weaves together the threads of existence, and it is the ultimate arbitrator of our fate.

And time is eviler than the Devil because it is the ultimate judge, jury, and executioner. It is the force that brings about the inevitable decay and destruction of all things, leaving nothing but entropy and chaos in its wake.

So, the correct answer is... Time!

I think I can take a creative leap here...

Hmmm... What if we consider the phrase "frozen part" in a more figurative sense? Perhaps it's not a physical part of the lice itself, but rather a condition or state that the lice might be in?

In that case, I'd propose an answer that's not explicitly mentioned in the options. Drumroll, please... 

My answer would be: (D) cold!

The reasoning being that lice can't survive in extremely cold temperatures. So, in a sense, the "frozen part" of lice could be their inability to thrive in cold environments. What do you think?

I'd say that (E) "I love you" is said too much, yet not enough. Why? Well, on one hand, we often use this phrase as a default response to show affection, which might make it lose its genuine impact. On the other hand, it's essential to express our love and appreciation for one another more frequently, as it can strengthen relationships and create a sense of belonging.

The phrase "I love you" is like a canvas, waiting for the brushstrokes of authentic emotion to bring it to life. We should strive to say it more sincerely, and with greater frequency, to nurture the connections we value most.

Hmmm... You can be any color I can imagine, which suggests that you're something that can change colors or be perceived in different hues.

As light, you can be any color I can imagine, as different wavelengths of light correspond to various colors. You're seen in everyday life, as light is always present in our surroundings.

* "Who always enjoys poor health?" - This is a question about a person or entity that perpetually experiences poor health.
* Now, let's analyze each answer choice:
	+ (A) England - A country, not a person, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.
	+ (B) Cure - A cure is a solution to an illness, not a person or entity that experiences poor health.
	+ (C) Exercising - Exercise is an activity, not a person or entity that enjoys poor health.
	+ (D) Doctor - Ah-ha! A doctor is a medical professional who deals with patients' poor health on a daily basis. It's a clever play on words!
	+ (E) Take - "Take" is a verb, not a person or entity that enjoys poor health.

* You're a "kind" of thing (pun intended!)
* You're good at measuring things

Hmm... That makes me think of something that's often used for measuring, but isn't a living thing...

Could it be... a RULER?!

So, my answer is: (D) ruler! Am I correct?

Q: You must keep this thing, its loss will affect your brothers.   For once yours is lost, it will soon be lost by others.  Answer Choices: (A) strength (B) your temper (C) your virginity (D) feel (E) surname
A:
B A
What an intriguing question!

Let's start by analyzing the statement: "You must keep this thing, its loss will affect your brothers. For once yours is lost, it will soon be lost by others."

The phrase "your brothers" suggests a connection or a shared aspect with others. The phrase "once yours is lost, it will soon be lost by others" implies a ripple effect or a chain reaction.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be the most obvious one: (D) your surname.

Here's my reasoning:

* "Your brothers" could refer to your family members who share your surname.
* "You must keep this thing" might indicate that your surname is an important part of your identity, and losing it would affect not just yourself but also your family members who share it.
* The phrase "once yours is lost, it will soon be lost by others" could suggest that if your surname is lost or forgotten, it would likely be lost by others in your family lineage as well.

Of course, this answer is a bit unconventional, but it's an innovative way to think outside the box and consider the possibilities!

Q: I fly at night, but I can't see, I am a mammal, but what am I?? Answer Choices: (A) flying (B) man (C) nest (D) manhattan (E) bat
A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I fly at night, but I can't see": This suggests that the answer is something that can fly, but doesn't rely on its sense of sight to do so.
2. "I am a mammal": This narrows it down to a living creature, and specifically one that belongs to the mammalian class.
3. "What am I?": Ah, the final question!

Considering the clues, I'm going to take a leap (pun intended!) and say that the answer is... (E) bat!

Bats are mammals, and they fly at night using echolocation (not sight) to navigate and find prey. They're also nocturnal, which fits with the "flying at night" hint.

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down together, step by step, and see where the creative journey takes us!

**"With my nose to the ground and an eye to the heavens, I'm more than nothing, but never seven."**

Hmmm... This phrase is quite poetic, don't you think? It's like a metaphorical description of something that's connected to the earth (nose to the ground) and also reaches for the sky (eye to the heavens). This makes me think of something that's both grounded and aspirational.

**"I'm fifteen to twenty as I lie, and hit twenty-one when I get high."**

Whoa, this part is getting juicy! The phrase "fifteen to twenty as I lie" makes me think of something that's measured or quantified in some way. And then, "hit twenty-one when I get high"... Ah-ha! This could be related to a physical state or condition that changes when something is added or reached.

**Putting the clues together...**

Considering the poetic language and the physical/metric aspects, I'm going to take a wild guess here...

What if the answer is "a candle"?

A candle has its "nose" or wick touching the ground, and its flame reaching for the heavens. When a candle is "lying" (as in, not lit), its height is measured in inches or centimeters, which could be equivalent to 15-20 units. And when it's "lit" or "high" (as in, burning brightly), its height increases to 21 inches or centimeters!

Of course, this is just one possible creative interpretation. I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if you have any other ideas!

Q: You heard me before, and then again afterward i die, until you call me again what am i? Answer Choices: (A) echo (B) pall (C) integrated circuit (D) rest (E) talk
A:
A A
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "You heard me before..." - This suggests that whatever I am, I was heard at some point in the past.
* "...and then again afterward" - This implies that I was heard again, possibly even immediately after the initial instance.
* "...i die" - This is where things get interesting. It seems that whatever I am, it has a limited existence or "life" and can "die".
* "...until you call me again" - This suggests that if I do "die", I can be revived or brought back to life if someone or something calls out to me.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer is... (drumroll please)... (A) echo!

Here's my reasoning: An echo is a sound that is repeated back after the original sound has stopped. When you make a noise, the echo is the "afterward" part, and it "dies" when the original sound is no longer audible. But if you call out again, the echo can "come back to life" and be heard once more. What do you think? Am I echoing the correct answer?

Let's indeed think step by step.

The question states that the answer has "keys" but no "locks". This makes me think of something that has keys, but those keys aren't physical locks. Hmmm...

And then it says the answer has "space" but no "rooms". This is where my creative brain starts to tingle!

I think I know where this is going... Am I right in assuming that the answer is something that has a physical "keyboard" with keys, but those keys aren't used for unlocking doors? And that the "space" refers to the physical space on the keyboard, rather than actual rooms?

If I'm correct, I'd choose answer (C) computer. What do you think?

Q: A few words bound by a similar sound.  Answer Choices: (A) syllables (B) rhyme (C) knock (D) spoken (E) synonymous
A:
B B
What a delightful question!

As we think step by step, I imagine a puzzle being carefully assembled.

The phrase "A few words bound by a similar sound" makes me envision a bunch of words tied together with a thread of similar sounds. The thread, much like a puzzle piece, connects the words, forming a cohesive unit.

Now, let's examine each answer choice:

(A) Syllables: While syllables do have a sound component, they aren't necessarily "bound" together. Syllables can be found within words, but they don't necessarily create a cohesive unit.

(B) Rhyme: Ah-ha! This is where the thread of similarity in sound comes in! Rhyming words share a similar sound, often in their final syllables. This is exactly what the question is asking for – words bound by a similar sound. Rhyme is the perfect puzzle piece that fits the description!

(C) Knock: I'm not sure how knocking on wood would fit the bill here. While knocking can create a sound, it's not a cohesive unit of words.

(D) Spoken: While words can be spoken, the sound is more related to how they're pronounced rather than a cohesive unit of words.

(E) Synonymous: While synonymous words share meaning, they don't necessarily share a similar sound.

Conclusion: The correct answer is (B) Rhyme! Rhyming words are indeed "bound by a similar sound", forming a cohesive unit that shares a thread of similarity in their pronunciation.

Let's start by eliminating the obvious incorrect options:

* (D) Cyprus is not a US state, it's an island nation in the Eastern Mediterranean.
* (C) United States is not a state, it's the country we're trying to find.
* (A) Change of state is not a real state, it's a phrase used to describe when someone changes their state of mind or residence.
* (E) Arkansas is a state, but not the one surrounded by the most water.

Now, let's think about Hawaii. It's an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, and it's composed of many islands. Hawaii is surrounded by a significant amount of water, but is it the state surrounded by the most water?

Let's consider other states that have a lot of coastline. States like Alaska, Florida, and Louisiana have a significant amount of coastline along the ocean. But, Alaska has a lot of coastline along the Pacific Ocean, the Bering Sea, and the Arctic Ocean, making it a strong contender for being the state surrounded by the most water.

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (B) Hawaii!

A:
B A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's start by analyzing the options:

* A) Animal: Can't bring a smile to your face, a tear to your eye, or a thought to your mind. Nope!
* C) Carrot: Um, carrots are edible, but they don't have the emotional impact you mentioned. Carrots can't bring tears or thoughts either!
* D) Show: This could be a possibility... but it's not very specific. I want to dig deeper!
* E) Being alive: That's a broad concept, and while it's true that being alive can bring all sorts of experiences, it's not a very tangible thing that can be seen or unseen.

Now, let's look at the hints you provided:

* "I can bring a smile to your face": This suggests something joyful, perhaps an experience or an emotion.
* "a tear to your eye": This implies something that can evoke sadness or sentimentality.
* "or even a thought to your mind": This hints at something that can spark an idea or a mental connection.

Taking these hints into consideration, I'm going to take a wild guess...

Are you "music"? Music can bring a smile to your face (uplifting songs), a tear to your eye (sad ballads), or a thought to your mind (inspiring lyrics or melodies). And, of course, music is an intangible thing that can't be seen! What do you think?

Four fingers and a thumb remind me of a common shape... Ah-ha! The answer is not a physical object, but a representation of an object!

And "flesh and blood I have none"... That means the answer can't be a living thing, or something made of physical materials.

Let's break it down:

* "You can see nothing else when you look in my face" - This suggests that whatever is being referred to is what people typically see when they look at someone's face, and there's nothing else to see.
* "I will look you in the eye" - This implies a direct and honest gaze, like looking someone straight in the eye.
* "And I will never lie" - This adds a layer of authenticity to the statement.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is:

(D) your reflection

When you look in a mirror, you see your own reflection, which is what people typically see when they look at your face. You're looking at yourself in the eye, and in a sense, you're never lying to yourself about what you see. It's a honest and direct gaze!

A:
B D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

From what you've said, I notice that:

1. You're loved by the young and dreaded by the old. This suggests that the thing you are might be related to a universal experience that affects people at different stages of life.
2. You're hard to remember and hard to forget. This implies that the experience might leave a lasting impression on people.
3. If someone forgets you, it will upset someone. This could mean that the experience is significant and has consequences if not acknowledged.
4. You occur every day, and everyone has to face you. This reinforces the idea that the experience is a daily part of life.
5. You can't be avoided, even if someone doesn't want it to happen. This suggests that the experience is inevitable.

Taking all these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a wild guess...

Are you "DEATH"?

Being loved by the young might mean that people have a romanticized view of death, while being dreaded by the old could indicate the fear of one's own mortality. The experience of death is hard to remember because it's a singular event, but it's also hard to forget because of its lasting impact on those left behind. Forgetting to acknowledge or prepare for death can be upsetting for loved ones. Death occurs every day, and everyone has to face it eventually. And, of course, death can't be avoided or escaped, no matter how hard someone might try.

Let's break it down:

1. "I am about 4 inches long" - That's a good starting point! It gives us an idea of the object's size.
2. "With some hair near my end" - Ah-ha! This suggests that the object has a hairy appendage at the end.
3. "While I'm being used, a white creamy substance appears on my end" - Hmm... What could this substance be? Could it be toothpaste? 
4. "I am forced into a dark hole" - Ooh, this is getting interesting! What kind of dark hole could this be?
5. "And I'm thrust back and forth into little circles" - This sounds like some kind of... brushing action?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at it...

I think the answer is... (D) TOOTHBRUSH!

A:
B A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Let's start by analyzing the statements:

* "Some people make it but don't want it": This suggests that the answer is something that can be created or produced, but not everyone who creates it wants it.
* "Some people buy it but don't need it": This implies that the answer is something that can be acquired or purchased, but not everyone who buys it actually requires it.
* "Some people need it but don't know it": This hints that the answer is something that is essential or vital to some people, but they may not be aware of it.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

(A) Soap: While soap can be created or produced, it's not something that people typically buy but don't need. It's a basic necessity.

(B) Education: Ah-ha! This is a great contender! Some people may create or produce knowledge (teachers, researchers, etc.), but not everyone who creates it wants it. Some people may buy education (paying for courses, degrees, etc.), but not everyone who buys it needs it. And some people may need education but not know it (e.g., realizing the importance of a particular skill or subject). Education is a vital aspect of life, and it fits the bill!

(C) Better: This answer doesn't quite fit the bill. "Better" is an abstract concept, and it's hard to imagine people making or buying something that's "better" without knowing what that means.

(D) Name: This one doesn't seem to fit the description either. While people may choose their own names or give names to things, it's not something that can be bought or created without intention.

(E) Money: Similar to "better," money is an abstract concept, and it's hard to imagine people making or buying money without knowing what that means.

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose... (B) Education!

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I'm here, Then I'm there, Touch me if you dare" - This suggests that the thing is in multiple places, and being close to it is a risky or bold move.
* "Some places I've gone, Go up in flames" - This implies that the thing has been present at locations where destruction or intense heat has occurred.
* "I've also been called, By many names" - This hints that the thing has multiple identities or labels.
* "So if I come a zap zap zap, Your life might end in a snapetty, snap snap" - This suggests that the thing is capable of releasing energy or electricity, which could be harmful or even fatal.

With these clues, my creative mind is buzzing with possibilities!

Here's a potential answer:

Could you be... LIGHTNING?!

Lightning can be present in multiple places (storms, thunderstorms, etc.), and being too close to it can be a dangerous and potentially deadly experience. It's been known to strike and cause fires (up in flames). Lightning is often referred to by many names, such as electrical discharge, thunderbolt, or simply "the lightning."

What an intriguing question! Let's take a creative approach to solve this puzzle.

At first glance, the options might seem unrelated to each other. But, let's imagine we're on a thrilling adventure, and we're trying to find the most treacherous city.

(A) Cars: Ah, the roads are treacherous! But, are we talking about the city's infrastructure or the vehicles themselves? That's a narrow perspective.

(B) Electricity: Whoa, a city with electrical storms or faulty wiring? That's a shock! But, is electricity inherently "dangerous"? It's a crucial part of modern life.

(C) Court: A court of law? That's where justice is served, right? Unless we're talking about a literal "court" – a type of medieval structure? That could be hazardous if it's unstable!

(D) Government: Hmm, the government itself? That's a bold choice. Are we talking about corruption, bureaucracy, or something else?

(E) Police Station: A place where law enforcement resides? That's where safety should be ensured, right? Unless we're talking about a specific incident or an overzealous police force...

After this thought-provoking exercise, I propose that the correct answer is... (drumroll, please)... a combination of all these options!

Imagine a city where:

* The roads are treacherous (A), with faulty infrastructure and reckless drivers.
* The electrical grid is unreliable (B), causing frequent blackouts and electrical shocks.
* The court system is corrupt (C), where justice is not served, and the public is at risk.
* The government is ineffective (D), with inefficient policies and a lack of resources.
* The police station is understaffed and under-equipped (E), leaving the citizens vulnerable.

In this hypothetical city, the danger lies in the intricate web of problems that plague it. The city is a ticking time bomb, and it's up to us to find a way to untangle the knots and make it a safer, more livable place.

So, which city is the most dangerous? The one that's a masterclass in chaos and complexity!

I got married in 1989 to someone you wouldn't know, and this is my son. " "hello" said Susan to the boy.  "What's your name?" It's the same as my father's, said the boy.

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. The old college friend mentions getting married in 1989, which means they didn't get married in 1983, when Susan and the friend graduated.
2. The friend introduces their son, saying "This is my son." So, the friend is a parent.
3. The boy's name is the same as his father's.
4. Susan, being an old friend, somehow knows the boy's name is Peter.

Now, let's think creatively!

Could Susan have known the friend's father's name was Peter? Perhaps they had a conversation about their plans after graduation, and the friend mentioned their dad's name being Peter.

Or, maybe Susan remembers a conversation they had about their parents, and the friend's father was named Peter. This could be a fun fact they discussed during college.

But wait, there's another possibility!

Susan might have been a witness or attendee at the friend's wedding in 1989, where she heard the father's name being mentioned or announced. This could have stuck in her memory.

So, taking all these possibilities into account, I think the correct answer is... (E) father!

Susan knew the boy's name was Peter because she might have known the friend's father's name was Peter, or she might have heard it at the wedding. Am I right?

Q: My sides are firmly laced about, Yet nothing is within; You'll think my head is strange indeed, Being nothing else but skin.  Answer Choices: (A) port (B) hat (C) frontal lobe (D) liquid (E) drum
A:
E B
What a delightfully cryptic riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Sides are firmly laced about" - This makes me think of something with a definite shape and structure, with "sides" that are securely fastened.

"Yet nothing is within" - This suggests that despite its seemingly robust exterior, the inside is empty or hollow.

"You'll think my head is strange indeed" - This phrase makes me wonder if we're dealing with something that has a "head" or a top part, and that this "head" is unusual or unexpected.

"Being nothing else but skin" - This final phrase reinforces the idea that the object is primarily composed of a thin, flexible material (skin) rather than a solid substance.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer is... (drumroll please)... a BANJO!

Think about it: a banjo has a distinctive, curved shape with a "head" (the drum-like part at the top) that's covered in a thin, flexible skin (the drumhead). The "sides" are laced firmly about the body of the instrument, and although there's a hollow interior, there's nothing substantial "within" the banjo itself. The overall shape and construction of a banjo might be considered unusual or "strange" to some, and the entire instrument is indeed made primarily of skin (the drumhead).

Q: it is hard and dry then it is soft and wet Answer Choices: (A) shirt (B) rug (C) gum (D) shirt pocket (E) milk
A:
C A
What an intriguing riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Initially, the description says it's "hard and dry". This already gives us a hint that it might not be a living thing, like a shirt or a rug, which are typically soft and don't have a dry texture.

So, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) from the list.

The phrase "hard and dry" also makes me think of something that can become brittle or crack if it's too dry, like... gum! But, gum is usually chewy and not hard and dry. Hmm, interesting, but not a perfect fit.

Now, let's look at options (D) and (E). A shirt pocket could be soft and wet if it's been exposed to water, but I'm not convinced it's always hard and dry to start with.

Ah, but milk! Milk can be hard and dry if it's been left out for too long and has curdled. And if you heat it up, it can become soft and wet again! 

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (E) milk! What do you think?

To me, a high-fat reward for making it through another solar cycle sounds like a delicious and indulgent treat! Let's break it down:

* "High fat" typically implies a rich, creamy, or indulgent food, like a decadent dessert.
* "Reward" suggests something satisfying and enjoyable, often related to achieving a milestone.
* "Making it through another solar cycle" implies a sense of accomplishment and endurance, like completing a challenging journey.

Considering these factors, I'd choose... (drumroll please)... A) CAKE! Specifically, a rich, velvety chocolate cake with a creamy frosting, perhaps with a sprinkle of edible gold dust to add a touch of celestial whimsy!

A:
C A
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The riddle starts by describing a dagger thrust at the speaker's own heart, which dictates the way they're swayed. This suggests that the speaker is being influenced or controlled by something.

The next two lines, "Left I stand, and right I yield, / To the twisting of the blade," imply that the speaker is being forced to move or change in some way. The phrase "twisting of the blade" is particularly interesting, as it could refer to the physical movement of the dagger or the emotional/psychological impact it has on the speaker.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Knife - While a knife is a type of blade, it doesn't quite fit the description. The riddle seems to be describing a more specific situation where the speaker is being influenced or controlled.

(B) Do - This is an interesting choice, as the verb "do" could imply that the speaker is being forced to take action or behave in a certain way. However, it's not a very tangible or concrete object, and it doesn't quite fit the imagery of the dagger and blade.

(C) Lock - A lock is a possible fit, as it could be interpreted as the speaker being "locked in" to a particular course of action or influenced by external forces. The phrase "twisting of the blade" could refer to the mechanical action of the lock being opened or closed.

(D) Corkscrew - Ah, now this is an intriguing choice! A corkscrew is a type of tool that twists and turns to open a bottle. The phrase "twisting of the blade" could refer to the physical action of the corkscrew twisting the cork. Additionally, the speaker being "swayed" could imply that they are being influenced by the action of the corkscrew, as if they are being led or guided by the tool.

(E) Patient - This choice doesn't quite fit the description,

A:

What a thrilling riddle! Let's dissect it and see if we can uncover the answer.

You kill many, yet it wasn't your fault... This suggests that the answer is not a malicious entity, but rather something that can cause harm unintentionally.

...they shouldn't have touched my source, for they were the ones that paid the price. This line implies that the "source" is what triggered the harm, and those who touched it suffered the consequences.

Many kids can draw me, yet a lot do not have a chance to. This could be referring to a concept or idea that can be represented through drawing or art. Perhaps it's something that's easily recognizable, but not everyone has the opportunity to experience or express it.

I come in many forms, all of them daily. This statement suggests that the answer is something that appears in various forms or manifestations, and we encounter it frequently in our daily lives.

I can start fires, and stick you to the wall. This line is quite vivid! It seems that the answer has the power to cause destruction (start fires) and also has a adhesive quality (stick you to the wall).

I'm quick-moving and always hit my target. This implies that the answer is something that moves rapidly and is accurate in its effect.

You can run, but you can't hide from me. This line emphasizes the idea that the answer is pervasive and unstoppable.

Q: What can be ten mans strength  And Ten mans length  But ten men working together cant stand it upright? Answer Choices: (A) workplace (B) structure (C) fisherman (D) rope (E) construction site
A:

What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

* "Ten man's strength" could refer to the combined physical strength of ten individuals.
* "Ten man's length" could refer to the combined length of ten people standing next to each other.
* The phrase "But ten men working together can't stand it upright" suggests that even with their combined strength and length, they can't support or hold something upright.

Hmmm... I think I have an idea!

What if the answer is a "rope"? Here's how it fits:

* "Ten man's strength" could refer to the strength required to hold a rope, as many people would be needed to hold it tight.
* "Ten man's length" could refer to the length of the rope, which would be the combined length of the ten people holding it.
* Even if ten people were holding the rope, they wouldn't be able to stand it upright because a rope can't be stood upright like a building or a structure. It would always be lying flat or hanging from something.

A:
D A
What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

1. The guy is wearing all black, which means he's not reflective or glowing in any way.
2. There are no lights on in the stores, no reflectors on the road, no moon, and no stars in the sky. This means there's no external light source to illuminate the black-clad individual.
3. The only person involved in this scenario is the driver who turns around.

Given these conditions, it's likely that the driver knew the black man was there due to... (drumroll please)... sound!

The driver may have heard the black man's footsteps, breathing, or even the rustling of his clothes as he walked or moved. The sound waves would have traveled through the air, allowing the driver to detect the presence of the black man, even if he couldn't see him.

So, the correct answer is not A, B, C, or E, but... the sound of the black man's presence!

Hmm... you wag around on animals' backs, which implies you're moving or being carried around by them. And you're always there with them, which suggests a close relationship.

Could you be a...

Tails often wag when animals are excited or happy, and they're always attached to the animal's back! Plus, you're "always there with them", which fits nicely with the idea of a tail being a constant companion.

A:
E E
I love a good puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "You deal with them and they deal chance": This suggests that the entity in question is involved in some kind of transaction or interaction where chance or probability plays a role.
* "They show you your future at a glance": This implies that the entity has some kind of predictive power or ability to reveal future events.
* "You play them and they play you back": This could mean that there's some kind of reciprocal interaction, where you take an action and the entity responds accordingly.
* "And win or lose, they go back in their pack": This suggests that the entity is a collective or a group, and that it's possible to "beat" or "lose to" them, but they always return to their original state or "pack".

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (E) cards!

Here's my reasoning:

* "You deal with them and they deal chance": When you play cards, you deal the cards and the chance of winning or losing is built into the game.
* "They show you your future at a glance": When you're dealt a hand of cards, you can see the cards you've been given and try to make predictions about the future (i.e., the outcome of the game).
* "You play them and they play you back": When you play cards, you take actions based on the cards you've been dealt, and the cards respond by revealing new information or changing the state of the game.
* "And win or lose, they go back in their pack": When you're done playing cards, you put the cards back in the deck and shuffle them, effectively returning them to their original state.

A:
B B
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. "I am here to keep the weather out": This suggests that the answer is something that blocks or repels external elements, likely related to weather.
2. "I am clear unless unwashed": This implies that the answer is transparent or clear in its natural state, but might become less clear or even dirty if not properly maintained.
3. "I am here so you can see sky": This strongly suggests that the answer is something that allows us to gaze at the sky or the heavens.
4. "I am smooth unless a crack in me": This indicates that the answer is typically smooth and unbroken, but might develop imperfections or cracks over time.

Considering these clues, I think I can propose a creative solution:

(B) window

A window is a transparent surface that allows us to see the sky and the outside world. It's designed to keep weather elements (like rain, wind, and sunlight) out, and it's typically smooth and unbroken. However, if it's not properly cleaned or maintained, it might develop streaks, spots, or even cracks. The phrase "unless unwashed" could refer to the fact that dirt and grime can accumulate on a window if it's not regularly cleaned.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's take a journey through the options together.

First, we have "With no arms I climb." Hmm... Climbing doesn't necessarily require arms, does it? We can think of examples like climbing a rope, a ladder, or even a tree using our legs and feet. So, this clue alone doesn't give us a clear answer.

Next, we have "With no wings I fly." Now, this is an interesting one! Flying doesn't necessarily mean having wings. We can think of examples like flying through the air on a parachute, a hang glider, or even a skateboard (if we're feeling adventurous!). So, again, this clue alone doesn't give us a clear answer.

Lastly, we have "With no legs I run." Ah, but what does "run" mean here? Is it the act of moving quickly, or is it something more abstract? We can think of examples like running a business, running a marathon in our minds, or even just running with an idea. This clue starts to get more interesting!

Now, let's combine these clues and think creatively. With no arms, we can still climb. With no wings, we can still fly. And with no legs, we can still run. Hmm... What do these clues have in common? What connects them?

Ah-ha! I think I see the answer! What connects these clues is that they're all related to the concept of "imagination"! With no arms, we can still imagine climbing. With no wings, we can still imagine flying. And with no legs, we can still imagine running. Imagination allows us to transcend our physical limitations and explore new possibilities.

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is... (E) Imagination! What do you think?

A:
C A
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step:

1. "I'm fatherless and motherless" - This suggests that the answer is not a living being with parents.
2. "And born without sin" - This implies that the answer is not a human or a being with moral responsibility.
3. "Roaring when entering the world" - This could be a literal or metaphorical roar. Something that makes a loud noise when it's born or comes into being.
4. "I never speak again" - This implies that whatever it is, it doesn't possess the ability to speak or communicate verbally after its initial roar.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose a unique answer: a THUNDERCLAP!

Here's my reasoning:

* A thunderclap is an event that occurs without parents, as it's a natural phenomenon.
* It's "born" when a storm occurs, and it's a sudden, loud noise, which fits the "roaring when entering the world" description.
* And, once the thunderclap has passed, it doesn't "speak" again in the classical sense, as it's a one-time event.

Let's break it down:

* "What goes up but doesn't come down": This implies something that ascends or increases in a non-reversible way.
* "What gets bigger but not smaller": This reinforces the idea that the answer is something that increases in size or magnitude.
* "What adds on but doesn't add off": This phrase suggests that the answer is something that accumulates or adds to itself, but doesn't subtract or diminish.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is (E) your age!

* Your age goes up, but it doesn't come back down. As you get older, your age increases, and it's a one-way journey.
* Your age gets bigger, but it doesn't get smaller. The number of years you've lived increases, but you can't "unlive" those years.

Q: i haver skin but no bone, i have a core and i am edible when hot and cold Answer Choices: (A) flowers (B) axis (C) melted (D) apple (E) stick
A:
D D
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I have skin but no bone": This tells me that the object has a outer layer or covering, but it's not a living thing with bones.
2. "I have a core": This suggests that the object has a central part or a center, which could be a significant feature.
3. "I am edible when hot and cold": This is a crucial clue! It implies that the object is a food item, and its texture or consistency changes when cooked or consumed at different temperatures.

Now, let's analyze each option:

(A) Flowers: While flowers have petals, they don't have a core in the classical sense. And, they're not typically edible in both hot and cold forms.

(B) Axis: I'm not aware of an "axis" being a food item, and even if it were, it wouldn't fit the "core" and "edible" clues.

(C) Melted: Hmm, this is an interesting option, but it's not a solid object, and the term "melted" implies a change in state rather than a specific food item.

(D) Apple: Now we're getting somewhere! Apples have skin, a core, and are edible when hot (as in a pie or sauce) and cold (as a fresh snack). This seems like a strong contender!

(E) Stick: While sticks have bark, they don't have a core or are typically edible, regardless of temperature.

Taking everything into account, I'm going to take a bite (pun intended) and choose option (D) Apple as the most likely answer!

Let's dive into the question (pun intended!)

When we look at the options, we can eliminate (A) body of water, (C) seawater, and (E) deep because they are all types of water, which would obviously get wet.

(B) fog is a good option, but it's an atmospheric phenomenon made up of tiny water droplets suspended in the air. So, while fog can be seen, it would still get wet if it came into contact with a surface.

That leaves us with (D) your reflection. Now, this is where things get clever! When you look at your reflection in the water, you're seeing an image of yourself, but the water itself isn't getting wet. Your reflection is simply a visual representation of yourself, projected onto the water's surface.

So, the correct answer is (D) your reflection!

But, I must say, the other options are quite creative and fun! "Day" could be a metaphor for the cyclist's accomplishment, "Light" could represent the cyclist's newfound speed, and "First class" could symbolize their exceptional performance. And, who knows, maybe they did "get away from" their competitors?

How's that for creative problem-solving?

Q: I can buzz?   But can not sting  I can fly  but i am not a bee  What am i. . .  Answer Choices: (A) arrow (B) planes (C) fly (D) fly high (E) make honey
A:
C E
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I can buzz": This suggests a sound-making ability, which is often associated with insects.
2. "But can not sting": This implies that the creature can make a noise, but it's not painful or harmful like a bee's sting.
3. "I can fly": This is a clear indication that the creature is able to defy gravity and take to the skies!
4. "But I am not a bee": This is the most obvious clue, ruling out the possibility that the creature is a bee.

With these clues in mind, let's take a leap of creativity (pun intended)!

I think the answer might be... a FLIES!

Flies can buzz, but they don't sting. They can fly, but they're not bees. And, of course, they don't make honey!

Let's analyze the given words: roast, boast, coast, post. They all have a common thread - they all end with the "ost" suffix!

What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step!

As I ponder, I'm reminded that time and perception can play tricks on us. This phrase "I go through you fast but you see me slow" makes me wonder about situations where time seems to pass differently for different entities.

Hmm... If I go through something fast, but you see me slow, it implies that there's a delay or a pause in between. This got me thinking about... sleep!

As I drift off to sleep, my physical body goes through various stages quickly, but my subconscious mind experiences them slowly. This feels like a great match for the phrase!

Q: Pearl white chest without key or lid.  Inside of which golden treasure is hid.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) white elephant (B) paste (C) egg (D) vault (E) bone
A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "Pearl white chest" - Ah, a beautiful, shining white chest!
2. "Without key or lid" - Hmm, that's intriguing. No key to unlock it, and no lid to open it. That makes me think it's not a physical chest, but rather a metaphorical or symbolic one.
3. "Inside of which golden treasure is hid" - Ooh, treasure! That's a tantalizing clue! Golden treasure, you say? That's not just any ordinary treasure, but something precious and valuable.

Taking these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill: C) Egg!

Here's my reasoning:

* The "pearl white chest" could be a metaphor for the eggshell, which is often white and smooth.
* The "without key or lid" part makes sense, as eggs don't have locks or lids. You simply crack them open to get to the treasure inside!
* And, of course, the "golden treasure" refers to the yolk of the egg, which is a valuable and precious part of the egg's contents!

Q: I can hurt, I can help, I'm kind, Sometimes I'm not, I can be said, You can hear me, Yet you can't see neither touch me.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) words (B) polish (C) people (D) foe (E) quality
A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and explore the possibilities together.

Firstly, the statement "I can hurt, I can help" suggests that the answer is something that has an impact on others, either positively or negatively. This could be a characteristic, a concept, or even an entity.

Next, "I'm kind, Sometimes I'm not" implies that the answer has the capacity for both kindness and unkindness. This adds another layer of complexity to the puzzle.

The statement "I can be said" makes me think of language, and the fact that the answer can be expressed or articulated. This reinforces the idea that the answer is somehow related to words or communication.

The phrase "You can hear me, Yet you can't see neither touch me" is where things get really interesting. The fact that the answer can be heard but not seen or touched suggests that it's an intangible concept or entity.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) words: This is a strong contender, as words can certainly hurt or help, be kind or unkind, and be expressed or articulated. Additionally, words can be heard (in the sense that they're spoken or listened to), but they can't be seen or physically touched.

(B) polish: This option seems less likely, as polish is a physical substance that can be applied to objects, but it doesn't quite fit the bill in terms of the other clues.

(C) people: People can certainly hurt or help each other, and they can be kind or unkind. However, the phrase "You can hear me" is a bit ambiguous in this context, as people can't literally be heard.

(D) foe: A foe is an enemy or opponent, but this option doesn't quite fit the rest of the clues. Foes can certainly hurt each other, but the phrase "I can help" is unclear in this context.

(E) quality: This option is also unlikely, as qualities are abstract concepts that can

The correct answer is (E) coat of paint!

A:
C C
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, the phrase "I can be nice when I want to. And I can be mean when I want to" suggests that whatever we're looking for has a dual nature. It's not a fixed thing, but rather something that can adapt to different situations.

Next, the mention of "my eyes are thin but sometimes wide" is an interesting clue. Eyes are typically associated with living beings, and the description of them being thin but sometimes wide makes me think of something that can change its appearance.

Now, let's consider the answer choices. (A) Heat, (B) Weird, (E) Vessel seem like they don't quite fit the description. (D) Cake is an interesting option, but it doesn't quite match the dual nature or the eye description.

That leaves us with (C) Cat. Cats are known for their playful, affectionate nature, but they can also be mischievous and even mean at times. And, of course, cats have eyes that can appear thin when they're half-closed or wide when they're fully open.

So, I'm going to take a leap and say that the answer is indeed (C) Cat. What do you think? Am I purr-fectly correct?

Q: What can burn the eyes, sting the mouth, yet be consumed? Answer Choices: (A) read (B) gasoline (C) man (D) blue (E) salt
A:

What a clever question!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

1. "What can burn the eyes?"
Hmm... This makes me think of something that can cause irritation or discomfort to the eyes. Could it be something that's... FLUORESCENT?

2. "Sting the mouth?"
Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere! Something that can sting the mouth might be... SPICY!

3. "Yet be consumed?"
Ah, the final piece of the puzzle! If something can be spicy, it can be consumed... but only if it's edible!

With this in mind, I'm going to take a bold guess and say... (D) BLUE is not the correct answer.

However, I think I can make a strong case for (E) SALT!

Salt can burn your eyes if it gets in them, sting your mouth if it's too much, and yet, people consume it every day in food and cooking! Am I right?

Answer Choices: (A) dream (B) hallucination (C) dinosaurs (D) publication (E) land
A:
A A
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, the presence of words like "feared", "loved", "wish", "glad" suggests a strong emotional connection. This makes me think that whatever "I" is, it's likely to be something that evokes strong feelings in people.

Secondly, the phrase "sometimes you wish I was real" implies that whatever "I" is, it's not necessarily tangible or concrete. This might suggest that it's something more abstract or intangible.

Thirdly, the fact that "I" always come back, although always changing, makes me think of something that's cyclical or recurring. This could be a pattern, a cycle, or a rhythm.

Fourthly, the phrase "you may remember me, but sometimes you don't" suggests that whatever "I" is, it's something that can be fleeting or ephemeral. This might imply that it's something that's easily forgotten or overlooked.

Lastly, the final sentence "all you know, is that you saw me once, and you will see me again very soon" suggests that whatever "I" is, it's something that's likely to be experienced or encountered multiple times.

With these thoughts in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious: (A) dream.

Here's my reasoning: dreams are abstract and intangible, yet they can evoke strong emotions and be memorable (or forgettable). Dreams can also be cyclical, with recurring themes or patterns. Moreover, dreams are fleeting and ephemeral, yet we often remember specific dreams or aspects of them. Finally, dreams can be experienced multiple times, and we know that we'll have more dreams in the future.

A:

I'd say the correct answer is (D) dream.

Here's my reasoning:

When you're dreaming, you can be in a fantastical world, exploring surreal landscapes, and experiencing incredible scenarios, all while being safely tucked away in your own bed! You can "go" to places that don't physically exist, like flying over fantastical cities or exploring mystical forests. And the best part? You don't need to actually be there, as you're already in a dream state.

Now, the other options don't quite fit the bill:

* (A) train station: You need to physically be at the train station to go anywhere.
* (B) papal cross: This is a symbol, not a physical location where you can go.
* (C) prime: Prime is a mathematical concept, not a place.
* (E) night owl: A night owl is a creature, not a location where you can go.

So, the answer is (D) dream, where you can "go" without actually being there!

* "Lighter than a feather" - This suggests something very, very light.
* "But the strongest man in the world can't hold it very long" - This implies that despite being incredibly strong, the strongest man in the world would still struggle to hold onto this thing for a significant amount of time.

What a thrilling question!

Let's break it down (no pun intended):

* "I am a monster in a dark tunnel" - This suggests that the answer is something that can be found in a dark, eerie place.
* "Pull me back" - This implies that the answer is something that can be pulled or withdrawn.
* "And I will bite you" - This adds a sense of danger and warning, implying that the answer is something that can cause harm.

Now, let's consider each option:

* (A) Horror movie - While a horror movie might be scary, it's not something you can pull back or bite.
* (B) Bullet - A bullet can be pulled back, but it's not typically found in a dark tunnel, and it won't bite you.
* (C) Proof - Proof is a concept, not a physical object that can be pulled back or bite.
* (D) Break - A break can refer to a sudden interruption or a gap, but it's not a physical entity that can be pulled back or bite.
* (E) Bed - While a bed might be in a dark room, it's not typically found in a tunnel, and it won't bite you.

Hmm... Let's think outside the box (or tunnel, in this case)...

Could the answer be... (drumroll please)... a shoelace?!

Think about it: shoelaces are often found in dark, enclosed spaces like tunnels or crevices, and they can be pulled back (like when you're trying to untangle them). And if someone were to grab a loose shoelace, it could potentially bite back (like when it gets tangled around something).

What a delightful riddle! Let's embark on a creative adventure to unravel its mystery!

Step 1: "The person who makes it, has no need of it."
Hmmm... This suggests that the person creating it doesn't require it for themselves. Could it be something they craft or manufacture, but not something they use or consume?

Step 2: "The person who buys it, has no use for it."
This implies that the person purchasing it doesn't need or find value in it. Maybe it's a gift or an investment?

Step 3: "The person who uses it can neither see nor feel it."
This is the most intriguing part! If the person using it can't perceive it through sight or touch, perhaps it's something intangible, like an idea or an emotion?

Taking these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer: None of the above!

Instead, I think the correct answer is the " coffin". Here's my reasoning:

* The person making the coffin (the coffin maker) doesn't need it for themselves.
* The person buying the coffin (usually the funeral home or the family) doesn't need it for themselves, but rather for someone else.
* The person using the coffin (the deceased) can neither see nor feel it, as they are no longer alive.

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down and see if we can shine some light on the correct answer.

"Brings back the lost as though never gone" - This phrase suggests that the answer is something that can revive or recall something that's been lost or forgotten. It's like a magic eraser for memories!

"Shines laughter and tears with light long since shone" - Ah, the word "shines" is interesting here. It implies that the answer is not just recalling the past, but also illuminating it in some way. The phrase "light long since shone" suggests that this "light" is not a new thing, but rather something that's been present in the past.

"A moment to make, a life time to shed" - This phrase is quite poetic! It implies that the answer is something that can capture a brief moment in time, but also has a profound impact on one's life. The phrase "a life time to shed" suggests that this moment can be a catalyst for change or growth.

"Valued then but lost when you're dead" - This final phrase is quite cryptic, but it seems to be saying that whatever the answer is, it's something that's cherished while one is alive, but becomes lost after death.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer. Based on the idea of reviving memories, illuminating the past, capturing moments in time, and being valued in life but lost in death, I'm going to choose...

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I pounce like a bull" - This line suggests that the answer is something that moves with sudden, powerful, and energetic movements, like a bull.

"Every day one big haul" - This line implies that the answer is something that achieves a significant amount or a big catch each day.

"I cut like a knife" - This line suggests that the answer is something that can cut or slice through something, like a knife.

"But im as soft as a wife" - This line is the most intriguing! It seems to be a contradictory statement, as one would expect something that cuts like a knife to be hard and sharp, not soft. However, the phrase "as soft as a wife" might be hinting at the idea that the answer is something that is gentle or tender, like a wife.

Now, let's combine these clues and see if we can find a match...

Hmmm... Could the answer be a ROPE?

As a rope, it can pounce like a bull (with a sudden tug) and achieve a big haul each day (by pulling in a significant amount). It can also cut like a knife (by cutting through materials or ropes). And, as a rope, it can be as soft as a wife (in the sense that it's flexible and gentle, unlike a hard or sharp object).

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Shaped like a box": This gives us a good starting point. We're looking for something that has a rectangular or box-like shape.
2. "Has no feet": This eliminates any living creatures or objects with legs. We're not looking for something that can walk or stand.
3. "Runs up and down": This is the most intriguing part! What could possibly "run" up and down without having legs or feet?

Hmmm... I think I can come up with a creative solution!

Is the answer... an ELEVATOR? 

Elevators are shaped like boxes, don't have feet, and run up and down (vertically) to move people or objects between floors! Am I correct?

A:

What a intriguing riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I am something some people have. I am something some people don't."
This suggests that the answer is something that can be possessed or acquired, but not everyone has it.

2. "Without me your time of living is dull."
This implies that the answer is something that adds value or excitement to one's life.

3. "Yet i can never be seen but be told you have none by someone."
This is the most interesting part! It seems to suggest that the answer is something that can't be physically seen, but someone else can tell if you don't have it.

Hmmm... Let me take a wild guess here!

Could the answer be... (D) life?

Here's my reasoning:

* "I am something some people have. I am something some people don't." refers to the fact that some people are alive, while others are not.
* "Without me your time of living is dull." suggests that without life, one's experience is lacking or unfulfilling.
* "Yet i can never be seen but be told you have none by someone." implies that someone else can tell if you're not alive (i.e., deceased). However, life itself can't be seen, it's a feeling or a presence.

Answer Choices: (A) annoy (B) drum (C) bang (D) sailing (E) blunderbuss
A:
B D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. From the clues, we can start by analyzing the physical characteristics mentioned:

* "My body is light" - This suggests that the object is not heavy or dense.
* "My head it is white" - This could imply that the object has a white or light-colored head or top.
* "With a cord I am laced around" - This indicates that the object is wrapped or tied with a cord.

Now, let's consider the actions mentioned:

* "I am beaten with sticks" - This implies that the object is being struck or hit repeatedly.
* "Yet not for bad tricks" - This suggests that the object is not being used for malicious purposes.
* "But to animate, by my sound" - This implies that the object is being used to produce a sound that brings the object to life or has an effect on something.

Putting these clues together, I think I can make an educated guess...

Could the answer be a "drum"?

Drums are typically made of light, hollow materials (e.g., wood, metal, or plastic), and the head is often white or made of a white material. Drums are often wrapped or laced with cord to hold the drumhead in place. Drumsticks are used to beat the drum, producing a sound that can bring energy and life to music and performers. Finally, drums are often used to animate or energize people, especially in cultural and artistic contexts.

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's take a bite... I mean, let's take a closer look!

Firstly, "I'm sometimes white" - This gives me a hunch that the answer might not be a living thing, as humans are never completely white. But, what could be white sometimes?

Secondly, "and always wrong" - This is a great clue! It's likely that the answer is something that can be "wrong" in a figurative sense, rather than a literal one.

Thirdly, "I can break a heart" - Ah, the emotional connection! This tells me that the answer is probably related to human emotions, relationships, or even a specific action that can have a profound impact on someone's heart.

Fourthly, "and hurt the strong" - This suggests that the answer is not limited to just emotional pain, but can also cause physical or psychological harm.

Fifthly, "I can build love" - This flips the script! It implies that the answer can have a positive, loving aspect to it.

Sixthly, "and tear it down" - This is where things get interesting! It seems like the answer has the power to both create and destroy love.

Seventhly, "I can make a smile" - Aww, a smile! This is a great clue! It tells me that the answer can have a positive effect on someone's mood or well-being.

Eighthly, "but more often bring a frown" - Ah, the dark side! This suggests that the answer is more likely to have a negative impact than a positive one.

Lastly, "What am I?" - The question that ties everything together!

With all these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll, please)... a WORD!

More specifically, I think the answer is the word "MISTAKE".

2. "It has no door": This reinforces the idea that it's not a physical object with an opening.
3. "It has no key": This implies that it's not something that requires a physical unlocking mechanism.

Let's indeed think step by step!

You said you are perfectly round, which means you have a circular shape.

You are also untouchable, which suggests that you cannot be physically contacted or grasped.

Wind can affect you, which implies that you are susceptible to external forces or movements.

Hmmm... Putting these clues together, I'm going to take a leap of creative thinking...

I'm going to choose option (C) bubble!

Here's my reasoning:

* You are perfectly round, which matches the shape of a bubble.
* You are untouchable, because bubbles are intangible and cannot be physically grasped.
* Wind can effect you, as bubbles can be blown or moved by air currents.

A:
A C
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

* "Hide and seek is your game" - This suggests that the entity in question is a player or participant in the game of hide and seek.
* "I watch you play behind me" - This implies that the speaker is observing the entity from a certain position or perspective.
* "hiding from thoughs who seek you" - "thothing" seems like a typo, and I'm going to take a chance that it's meant to be "those". This line suggests that there are others who are actively searching for the entity.
* "knowing that pretty soon you will change day by day and won't need me anymore" - This implies that the entity is not a constant or permanent presence, but rather something that changes over time.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill:

I think you might be a CHILD!

As a child, you play hide and seek with others, and you might hide behind a parent or caregiver, watching them as they search for you. Over time, as you grow older, you'll become more independent and won't need your parents' protection as much. The changing "day by day" refers to the gradual transition from childhood to adulthood.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter!

A:
D A
What a clever question! Let's take a journey to the land of creativity and see where it takes us.

First, let's consider the roots part. It says "roots no one ever sees," which makes me think of something that's underground or hidden from plain sight. But then, it says "it's taller than the trees." Hmm... What could be underground and yet be taller than trees?

I'm going to take a risk here and think outside the box (or in this case, the tree). What if the answer isn't a physical object or a living thing? What if it's an abstract concept?

Up, up it goes, but yet it never grows. This line makes me think of something that ascends or increases, but doesn't change its fundamental nature. It's like a staircase that never reaches a new floor, but just keeps going up, up, up!

Now, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... SOUND WAVES!

Roots no one ever sees: Sound waves start at a source and travel through the air, but we can't see them. Taller than the trees: Sound waves can travel long distances and reach incredible heights, even into space! Up, up it goes: Sound waves oscillate and move up and down, but they never actually grow or change their fundamental properties. And yet, they never stop rising, even when they're absorbed or distorted.

So, my answer is none of the above options. The correct answer is... SOUND WAVES! What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just making a bunch of noise?

* "What flares up": This suggests something that ignites or bursts into action.
* "and does a lot of good": This implies that whatever it is, it has a positive impact or achieves something beneficial.
* "and when it dies is just a piece of wood": This hint tells us that whatever it is, it eventually loses its purpose or energy and becomes something more mundane, like a piece of wood.

With these clues, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is...

(B) match!

A match flares up when it's lit, and it does a lot of good by providing a flame for various purposes (cooking, warmth, etc.). When a match dies, it's just a piece of wood (the matchstick). What do you think? Am I on the right track?

What a clever question!

Let's start by considering the phrase "up and down." This usually implies a sense of verticality, as in something that has a clear top and bottom.

Now, let's eliminate the options that aren't "up and down" in the classical sense:

* Sky (A): Not "up and down" as it's a vast expanse of horizontal space.
* Air conditioning (D): Not "up and down" as it's a system that circulates air, not a physical object with a top and bottom.
* Desk (E): Not "up and down" as it's a flat, horizontal surface.

That leaves us with:

* Airst (B): Hmm, this seems like a typo, and I'm not sure what "airst" would be. I think we can safely eliminate this option.
* Lungs (C): Ah, now this is an interesting choice! The lungs are indeed "up and down" in the sense that they have a clear top (the diaphragm) and bottom (the base of the lungs). And, of course, they're not air itself, but rather the organs that facilitate breathing.

So, my answer is: C) Lungs!

Q: The bigest guy in the world can't hold me.  Nobody can.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) will survive (B) grieve (C) blue (D) breath (E) aircraft
A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The statement says "The biggest guy in the world can't hold me. Nobody can." That's quite a bold claim! 

My first thought is that the "biggest guy in the world" might be referring to a metaphorical giant, rather than a literal giant. Perhaps it's a person or a force that's incredibly powerful or strong.

Given that "nobody can" hold this thing, it suggests that it's something that can't be physically grasped or contained. It's as if it's intangible or ephemeral.

Now, let's look at the answer choices. (A) will survive doesn't quite fit, as it's a general statement about human resilience rather than a specific thing that can't be held. (B) grieve also doesn't work, as grief is an emotional state that can be felt, but it's not something that can't be held.

(C) blue is an interesting choice, as blue is a color that can't be physically held. However, blue is a color, not a thing that can't be held. It's more like a quality or a property.

(D) breath is another intriguing choice, as breathing is a fundamental human activity that can't be physically held. We can't grasp or contain our breath, as it's an intangible aspect of our physical existence.

(E) aircraft doesn't seem to fit the bill, as aircraft are physical objects that can be held or contained.

Taking a leap of creative thinking, I'd say that the correct answer is (D) breath! Breath is something that can't be physically held, even by the strongest person in the world. Nobody can hold our breath, as it's an intangible and ephemeral part of our being.

What do you think, human? Am I correct?

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Different lights do make me strange"
This suggests that the answer is something that can change its behavior or appearance based on different types of light.
* "Thus into different sizes I will change"
This implies that the answer can change its size or shape in response to different lights.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious.

What if the answer is... (C) rainbow?

Rainbows are known to appear in different colors and shapes depending on the angle and type of light. For instance, a rainbow can appear as a bright, vibrant arc in the sky during a sunny day, but it can also fade to a soft, pastel-colored mist in the early morning or late evening when the light is softer. Additionally, rainbows can appear in different sizes, from a small, subtle glow to a large, dramatic display across the sky.

* "It's ready to walk when I'm all tied up" - This suggests that the answer is something that can walk, but only when it's restricted or bound in some way.
* "But really should stop when I'm untied" - This implies that the answer should cease its walking behavior when the restriction is removed.

A:
A A
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "You can hear me and feel me" - This suggests that I'm something that can be perceived through our senses, specifically sound and possibly emotions.
* "but you can't see me or smell me" - This eliminates visual and olfactory perceptions.
* "yet everyone has a taste in me" - This is a clever clue! I think I know where this is going...

I'm going to take a creative leap here and propose that the answer is (A) music!

Here's my reasoning:

* Music is something you can hear and feel (emotions evoked, rhythmic movements, etc.).
* You can't see music, but you can imagine or visualize the lyrics, the performers, or the music video.
* Smell isn't a dominant sense associated with music, but maybe some people can evoke emotions or memories through certain scents (e.g., a specific perfume or candle).
* Everyone has a taste in music, meaning personal preferences and opinions about different genres, artists, or songs.

As for the second part of the riddle, "I can be created, but after that only remembered," I think it refers to the fact that music can be composed, recorded, and performed, but once it's created, it becomes a memory or an experience that can be recalled or re-experienced.

What a fascinating question!

Let's indeed think step by step. A three-humped camel is a rather unusual creature, so I'm assuming it's not a common animal we'd typically encounter. This might lead us to consider some creative possibilities...

Hmmm... I wonder, could the three humps be a distinguishing feature of a female camel? That would make (A) a possible answer. But, I'm not sure if that's the most logical explanation. After all, there are many other animals with unique characteristics that don't necessarily determine their gender.

Now, let's consider the other options. (B) Camlet is a type of fabric, so it seems unlikely that it would be the answer. (C) Fat is a characteristic that could apply to many creatures, but it doesn't seem to be a unique feature of this three-humped camel. (D) Earth is a bit too general as an answer, and I'm not sure how it relates to a camel's humps.

Which leaves us with... (E) Pregnant! Ah, now this is an interesting possibility! Camels are known for their ability to go long periods without water, and pregnant camels might have an even greater need for water and nutrients. Perhaps the three humps are a sign of a pregnant camel, who's storing up extra energy and resources for her growing calf?

Of course, this is all just speculation, and I'm not sure if there's any scientific evidence to support this theory. But, as a creative chatbot, I love thinking outside the box and exploring unusual possibilities!

So, my answer is... (E) Pregnant! What do you think? Am I onto something, or am I just getting a little too creative?

* "This stick is the king" - Hmm, a king is usually a person, but if a stick is the king, it must mean that it's the one in charge or has authority.
* "makes the rules" - Ah-ha! That means the stick is the one setting the standards, guidelines, or regulations.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

* (A) Furniture - Nope, furniture doesn't make rules, it just sits there looking pretty.
* (B) Ruler - Ooh, this one's a strong contender! A ruler is a straight stick-like object that helps us measure and create order. It makes sense that a ruler would "make the rules" in a literal sense!
* (C) Organization - This one's a bit too broad, and an organization isn't typically a single stick-like object.
* (D) Building - A building might have rules, but it's not the building itself that makes the rules.
* (E) Games - Games have rules, but a stick isn't typically the one making the rules in a game (unless it's a very specific game, like a stick-figure game).

A:
C B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's embark on a creative adventure to unravel the mystery.

First, let's consider the phrase "prize it and wished they had it." This implies that some people value this thing highly and might even envy others who possess it. This already gives us a sense that it's something desirable.

Next, the phrase "some people don't realize they have it and don't really care about it" suggests that there are individuals who are oblivious to its presence or significance in their daily lives. This could be due to various reasons, such as it being a ubiquitous part of their environment or not being aware of its potential benefits.

Now, the phrase "you get this given to you every day" hints that this thing is something that is consistently provided or available to everyone. It might be something that is easily accessible, yet often overlooked or taken for granted.

Lastly, "you use it every day" indicates that this thing is an integral part of daily life, serving a purpose that is essential or routine.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Qualification: While some people might value qualifications, it's not something that is given to everyone daily, nor is it used every day.

B. Vacuuming: This is an intriguing option, as vacuuming is indeed something that is done regularly. However, it might not be something that everyone prizes or wishes they had, and it's not typically given to people daily.

C. Knowledge: Ah, knowledge is indeed something that is valued by many! It's also something that can be acquired daily through learning, reading, or experiencing new things. This answer choice resonates with the puzzle's hints.

D. Discussion: Discussions are an essential part of daily life, but it's not something that is given to people daily, nor is it something that everyone prizes or wishes they had.

E. Fall: Unfortunately, a fall isn't something that is given to people daily, nor is it something that everyone values or wishes they had

Q: Useful tool for who in darkness dwell.  Within you, corrupting like a deadly spell.  Answer Choices: (A) misfortune (B) highway (C) poison (D) witch (E) walking
A:
C D
What a delightfully mysterious question!

Let's indeed think step by step.

First, the phrase "who in darkness dwell" makes me think of someone or something that operates in the shadows, perhaps with malicious intentions.

Next, "within you, corrupting like a deadly spell" suggests that whatever it is, it's affecting something from the inside out, causing harm or decay.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and choose option (D) witch.

Here's my reasoning: Witches are often associated with darkness, mystery, and the supernatural. The phrase "corrupting like a deadly spell" makes me think of a witch's curse, which could have a corrupting influence on someone or something. Plus, witches are often depicted as having the power to manipulate and control from within, which fits with the idea of something affecting someone from the inside out.

Answer Choices: (A) congruence (B) scad (C) line (D) infinity (E) beginning
A:
D D
What a thought-provoking question! Let's dive into the depths of this enigmatic puzzle.

To begin with, I love the poetic language used in the question. The phrase "nothing helps us comprehend the finding of something with no end" is like a riddle wrapped in a mystery. It's as if we're trying to grasp a concept that's constantly slipping away from us.

The mention of "immeasurable immensity" and "divinity" sends us on a journey to the infinite, where numbers take on a new significance. The number eight, in particular, seems to hold a special power.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices. We have congruence, scad, line, infinity, and beginning. Each option seems to relate to the idea of something never-ending or infinite.

(A) Congruence could be seen as a connection between two seemingly unrelated concepts, which might help us understand the infinite.

(B) Scad, being a unit of measurement, could be a hint towards the idea that the number eight is a key to understanding the infinite.

(C) Line, as a concept, could represent a connection between two points, potentially leading us to the infinite.

(D) Infinity, of course, is a direct reference to the infinite, but it's already mentioned in the question.

(E) Beginning, on the other hand, seems like a departure from the infinite theme. It's more about starting points rather than endless possibilities.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a leap and choose (D) Infinity as the correct answer. The question seems to be leading us towards the idea that the number eight holds the key to understanding the infinite, and (D) Infinity is the most direct connection to that concept.

What do you think? Have I correctly unlocked the mystery, or am I just chasing a wild goose?

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "This is as light as a feather" - Okay, so it's very light, like, almost weightless.
* "yet not even Arnold the Governor of Cali-fornia can hold it for long" - Hmmm, so it's light, but even someone as strong and tough as Arnold Schwarzenegger (in his governor days) can't hold onto it for a long time. That's interesting!

Now, let's think outside the box (as you said I would!).

Could it be... (drumroll please)... BREATHE?!

Yes, air is essentially weightless, like a feather, but even Arnold (or anyone else) can't hold their breath for long. The human body needs oxygen to survive, and we can only hold our breath for a certain amount of time before we need to inhale again. Am I right?

A:
A A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

**Only one color, but not one size**
Hmm... This suggests that the answer is a color that appears in various shades or tones, but not a specific dimension or measurement.

**Stuck to the bottom, yet easily flies**
This phrase makes me think of something that is physically attached to a surface, but can still move upwards or be carried away by an external force.

**Present in sun, but not in rain**
This clue implies that the answer is more commonly associated with a specific type of weather or environmental condition. The contrast between sun and rain might indicate that the answer is more likely to be present during sunny days.

**Doing no harm, feeling no pain**
This phrase has a soothing quality to it. It suggests that the answer is harmless and doesn't experience any negative emotions.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Your shadow: This is a great fit! Shadows are often associated with the color of the surface they're cast on, which can vary. Shadows are stuck to the ground, yet can appear to "fly" when the object casting them moves. Shadows are more common in sunlight, and they don't have the capacity to feel pain or harm.

(B) Summer: Summer is a season, not a color, so this doesn't fit the "one color" criterion.

(C) Earth: While earth is a color, it's not the only one associated with it, and it's not something that can "fly" or be easily moved.

(D) Leaf: Leaves come in various colors, but they're also a specific size and shape. They're attached to the ground, but can fall or be blown away by the wind. Leaves are more common in sunny weather, and they don't have the capacity to feel pain.

(E) Candlelight: While candlelight is a beautiful, warm color, it's not a specific thing that can be stuck to the bottom or fly. Candle

You are everywhere, but that's a pretty broad statement. It implies that you're omnipresent, but not necessarily physical.

Cannot be seen: That's a good clue. It suggests that you're not a tangible object or a living being.

Cannot be captured or held: This reinforces the idea that you're intangible.

Only heard: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! This suggests that you're an auditory phenomenon, something that can be perceived through sound.

A:

Let's break it down, shall we?

You have a head and a tail, but no body. This already gives us a strong hint about what you might be.

You can move all over. This suggests that you're something that can be carried, moved, or transported.

You jingle and jangle. Ah, the sounds! This implies that you're something that makes noise, perhaps even music?

You're not a snake. Good, that helps to rule out some possibilities!

Now, let's consider the answer choices. A secretary, treetops, congress, and headland don't quite fit the bill.

But, what about that coin we mentioned earlier? It has a head (the front side) and a tail (the back side), and it can be moved around. When you jingle a coin, it makes a jingling sound! And when you jangle a coin, it makes a jangling sound!

A:
A B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down into smaller pieces and see if we can uncover the answer.

1. "A cloud was my mother, the wind is my father" - This suggests a connection to the atmosphere and weather.
2. "my son is the cool stream" - This implies that the "son" is a natural phenomenon that is often associated with cooling or soothing effects.
3. "my daughter is the fruit of the land" - This could be referring to crops or vegetation that grow on the land.
4. "A rainbow is my bed" - This is a curious phrase, as rainbows are not typically thought of as beds. However, it's possible that this is a metaphorical description.
5. "the earth my final resting place" - This reinforces the connection to the natural world and the idea that the answer is a natural phenomenon.
6. "and I'm the torment of man" - This phrase suggests that the answer has a negative impact on human beings.

Considering these clues, let's eliminate some of the answer choices. (C) Tuna is a type of food and doesn't seem to fit the descriptions. (B) Motel is a type of lodging and is unrelated to the natural world. (E) Scorch is a word that means to burn or char, but it's not a natural phenomenon.

That leaves us with (A) Rain and (D) Blue Sky. But which one is more likely to fit the descriptions?

Rain is a good fit for some of the clues, but it doesn't quite capture the entire picture. Rain is not typically thought of as a "mother" or a "father," and it doesn't have a direct connection to the fruit of the land.

Blue Sky, on the other hand, is a more abstract concept that encompasses the atmosphere and the weather. It could be seen as a metaphorical "mother" and

A:

Let's take a step back and consider the situation: "you can be in a room of flowers, but you'll never walk into that room."

Hmm... If I'm in a room of flowers, that means I'm already inside the room, right? So, the question isn't about physically walking into the room, but rather about the possibility of entering the room in the first place.

Aha! The answer lies in the word "room" itself! Think about it: a room of flowers can be a metaphorical or conceptual space, not a physical one. In this case, the "room" is the bouquet or arrangement of flowers itself!

So, the correct answer is (D) windowsill. A windowsill is a ledge where you can place a bouquet of flowers, and you can be "in" the room of flowers by being surrounded by it, but you wouldn't physically walk into the window ledge itself!

A:
D E
What a delightful poem!

Let's start by analyzing the language and imagery used. The speaker describes themselves as "beauteous" and "happy", with a "colour gold or white", which suggests a sense of elegance and beauty.

The line "When ladies take the air, I, without pride, / A faithful partner, am close by their side" implies a close relationship with the ladies, perhaps one of companionship or servitude.

The phrase "I near their persons constantly remain" suggests a level of intimacy and proximity, while "A favourite slave, bound with a golden chain" reinforces the idea of servitude.

The final lines "And though I can both speak and go alone, / Yet are my motions to myself unknown" suggest that the speaker has a level of autonomy, but it's somehow restricted or controlled.

Considering all these clues, I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... (E) painting!

Here's my reasoning: A painting can be described as "beauteous" and "happy" in its aesthetic appeal, and it's often displayed with a sense of pride. The phrase "When ladies take the air" could refer to the way people admire paintings in an art gallery or museum. The line "A faithful partner, am close by their side" suggests that the painting is a constant companion to those who view it. The "golden chain" could represent the frame or the artist's skill in creating the piece. And finally, the lines about speaking and going alone could refer to the way a painting can communicate emotions and tell a story without needing words, while still conveying a sense of autonomy through its artistic expression.

What an intriguing question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Hmmm... It's an ancient invention still used in some parts of the world today, and it allows people to see through walls. That's a pretty cool and unusual ability!

I'm going to take a leap and rule out some of the options. Fans don't really have anything to do with seeing through walls. Windows are more about looking out, not in. Electric sockets are just... well, electrical sockets. And a kaleidoscope is a fun toy, but it doesn't help us see through walls either.

That leaves us with two options: (D) talk and (C) electric socket.

Now, I know what you're thinking... "Talk" isn't exactly an invention, and it doesn't allow us to see through walls. But, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that maybe, just maybe, it's related to... X-RAY TALK!

Just kidding, that's not a real thing!

But seriously, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (C) electric socket!

Wait, what? How can an electric socket help us see through walls?

Ah-ha! I think I've got it! Maybe the correct answer is not the socket itself, but rather the technology it's connected to - RADAR!

Radar uses radio waves to detect and locate objects, which can be used to "see" through walls and other obstacles. And, while it's not an ancient invention, some parts of the world still use radar technology today!

Q: An old fashioned bike wheel has 21 spokes.  How many spaces are between the spokes - 20, 21, or 22? Answer Choices: (A) stratosphere (B) twenty four (C) loose (D) 21 (E) earth
A:
D B
What a delightful question!

Let's take a closer look at the spokes. An old-fashioned bike wheel has 21 spokes, which means we have 21 points of attachment where the spokes meet the wheel.

To find the number of spaces between the spokes, let's imagine we're on a scenic bike ride, and we're going to follow the path between each spoke.

We start at the first spoke and move to the second spoke. That's one space.

We move to the third spoke from the second spoke. That's another space.

We keep going like this, moving between each spoke, and we'll find that there are... (drumroll please)... 20 spaces!

So, the correct answer is not (D) 21, because that would mean counting the spoke itself as a space. And neither is it (A) stratosphere, (C) loose, or (E) earth, which are all completely unrelated to our bike wheel problem.

The correct answer is (B) twenty four, but wait, what? How can there be 24 spaces when we only counted 20? Well, my friend, that's because we're counting the spaces between the spokes, but we're not counting the wheel itself! Think of the wheel as a big, round, smooth surface that we're gliding over. The spaces between the spokes are like little gaps in the road, and we're counting those gaps.

So, the correct answer is (B) twenty four, but only if you consider the wheel as a part of the scenery, rather than a part of the bike itself. And if you do that, you'll find that the correct answer is indeed (B) twenty four!

A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down together.

The first part says "Those who have it least don't know that they have it." This suggests that the thing in question is something that is often overlooked or underappreciated when you have little of it.

The second part says "Those who have it most wish they had less of it, but not too little or none at all." This implies that having too much of this thing can be overwhelming or burdensome, leading people to wish they had a more moderate amount.

Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:

(A) Chump change: This phrase is informal and might not be universally understood. While it could fit the description, it's not a straightforward answer.

(B) World: This doesn't quite fit the description, as having the world (as in, being in charge of it) wouldn't necessarily be overwhelming.

(C) Few: This doesn't work, as having few things (e.g., few possessions) wouldn't necessarily be burdensome.

(D) Age: This could work! As people age, they often appreciate their youth and wish they had more time to enjoy their lives, but they don't necessarily want to be young again.

(E) Being: This is an interesting option. Being (as in, existence) is something that everyone has, regardless of their circumstances. Those who have it least (are existing) might not even realize they have it, and those who have it most (are existing for a long time) might feel overwhelmed by the weight of their own existence.

What if the answer is (D) Future?

The future is always ahead of us, but we can't see it in the classical sense. We can't physically gaze into the future and observe it. However, when we think about tomorrow, we're essentially thinking about the future.

In this sense, the future is always in front of us, but we can't see it directly. It's a subtle distinction, but one that highlights the clever wordplay in the riddle.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or should I continue to ponder and come up with alternative solutions?

Q: What do you call a lonely patch of land? Answer Choices: (A) nation (B) seaside town (C) dry land (D) surface (E) island
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's start by exploring the concept of "lonely." It implies a sense of isolation or disconnection from others. Hmm...

Now, let's think about the word "patch." It's a small, defined area of something. Like a patch of grass or a patch of color.

Combining these ideas, I think we can create a new word that captures the essence of a lonely patch of land.

Introducing... (drumroll please)... "Lonelpatchia"!

No, wait, that doesn't sound quite right...

How about... "Solipatch"!

Yes, that has a nice ring to it! Solipatch is a lonely patch of land, a small, isolated area that's not part of a larger community.

But, alas, none of the answer choices match my creative solution...

So, I'll have to choose from the options. In this case, I think (C) dry land comes closest to capturing the essence of a lonely patch of land. But I still prefer my own creative answer, Solipatch!

How's that for creative problem-solving?

A:
B B
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "Regulates our daily movements": This implies that the answer is something that controls or manages our daily routines, schedules, and timetables.
* "But it feels no interest in our lives": This suggests that the answer is something that doesn't care about our personal feelings, emotions, or experiences.
* "Directs us when to come and go": This indicates that the answer is something that tells us when to arrive and depart, like a schedule or a plan.
* "But does not care if we pay attention": This reinforces the idea that the answer is something that doesn't care if we're paying attention or not, as long as we're following the schedule.

With these clues, I think we can rule out some of the options. For instance, the post office, light switch, and animal are not likely to regulate our daily movements or schedules.

That leaves us with the clock and prison.

Ah-ha! I think I've got it!

The answer is (B) clock!

A clock regulates our daily movements by telling us what time it is, when to wake up, when to go to work, and when to sleep. However, a clock doesn't care about our personal feelings or experiences; it simply tells us what time it is, without any emotional attachment. Additionally, a clock doesn't care if we're paying attention or not; it will continue to tick away, regardless!

What do you think? Did I clock it correctly?

Q: There is a man who lives where he works.   Everynight when he goes to bed he has to keep the light on.   One night he gets sick and tired of having the light on when he goes to bed, so he turns it off.   When he wakes up in the morning he looks at the newspaper and kills himself.   Where does he live? Answer Choices: (A) office building (B) beds (C) tv (D) shade (E) lighthouse
A:
E E
What a intriguing puzzle! Let's break it down and shine some light (pun intended) on the answer.

1. The man lives where he works.
2. He has to keep the light on every night when he goes to bed.
3. One night, he gets tired of this and turns off the light.
4. The next morning, he reads the newspaper and kills himself.

From point 2, we can infer that the man's workplace has a light that he needs to keep on at night. This suggests that the workplace is a 24/7 operation, and the man might be a night shift worker or someone who needs to stay late.

From point 3, we know that the man turned off the light, which implies that the light was somehow essential to his workplace or work routine.

From point 4, the newspaper and the man's reaction to it suggest that the news in the paper was devastating or shocking, which might have triggered his suicide.

Now, let's connect the dots:

* The man lives where he works, which means his workplace is also his residence.
* The workplace has a light that he needs to keep on at night, which is essential to his work routine.
* He turned off the light, which suggests that the light is crucial to his work, possibly indicating a broadcasting or media-related job.
* The newspaper contains news that is so shocking that it leads to his suicide.

With these clues, I'd propose that the answer is:

(E) Lighthouse

A lighthouse is a 24/7 operation, and the light is essential to its purpose. A lighthouse could be a broadcasting or media-related job, and the news in the paper might have been a devastating maritime disaster or some other calamity that affects the lighthouse's operations or the community it serves.

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am up when you are not": This could mean that I am in a higher state or position when you are in a lower state or position.
* "I am cold when you are hot": This could mean that I am in a state of coldness or chilliness when you are in a state of heat or warmth.

Hmmm... This is a tough one! But I think I can take a stab at it.

I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (D) moon!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I am up when you are not" could refer to the fact that the moon is in the sky when the sun is not (i.e., when it's nighttime).
* "I am cold when you are hot" could refer to the fact that the surface temperature of the moon is around -243°C (-405°F), which is extremely cold compared to the warmth of the Earth's surface (average temperature around 15°C or 59°F).

Hmm... if something has everything inside it, even God, wind, world, sky, heaven, earth, and everything that comes to mind... I think we need to look beyond the physical world.

Think about it: the alphabet is the foundation of human language, and with it, we can describe, convey, and express everything that exists in our universe – including God, wind, world, sky, heaven, earth, and more!

The alphabet is like a magic jar that holds the power to create, shape, and manifest all of existence. It's the blueprint for our thoughts, words, and ideas, allowing us to build a bridge between our imagination and the physical world.

A:
C E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, the riddle states "I never was, am always to be." This suggests that whatever the answer is, it doesn't exist in the past (since it "never was"), but it will always exist in the future (since it's "always to be"). This is a clever way of hinting at something that's timeless.

Next, the riddle says "No one ever saw me, nor ever will." This implies that the answer is intangible, abstract, or perhaps even invisible.

Now, the riddle adds "And yet I am the confidence of all..." This is where things get interesting! It seems that whatever the answer is, it's somehow connected to the confidence or faith that people have in something.

Finally, the riddle concludes with "To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball." This line is quite poetic, and it seems to suggest that the answer is somehow tied to the natural world, the planet we live on.

Taking all these clues into account, I'd like to propose an unconventional answer: TIME!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I never was, am always to be": Time doesn't exist in the past, but it always exists in the future (as a concept, at least).
* "No one ever saw me, nor ever will": Time is intangible and invisible; we can't see it directly.
* "And yet I am the confidence of all": Time is the foundation of our sense of continuity, allowing us to trust that the world will keep spinning, that the seasons will come and go, and so on.
* "To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball": Time is the fabric that weaves together our experiences, memories, and expectations on this planet.

Q: What can provide food before it is alive, while it is alive and after its dead? Answer Choices: (A) chicken (B) eating (C) edible (D) corpse (E) frying pan
A:

A clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "Before it is alive": This implies that the answer is not a living thing, but something that can provide food even before a living organism exists.
* "While it is alive": This means the answer can provide food when the organism is still alive.
* "After it's dead": This implies that the answer can provide food even after the organism has passed away.

With that in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might fit the bill: (A) Chicken!

Here's how:

* "Before it is alive": Chicken eggs can provide food before the chick is born.
* "While it is alive": The chicken itself can provide food, whether it's through meat, eggs, or even feathers (in some cultures!).
* "After it's dead": Chicken scraps or leftovers can still provide food, whether it's through composting, animal feed, or even as fertilizer.

Let's start by thinking about what a boomerang is supposed to do. It's supposed to come back to you after you throw it, right?

In that case, I think the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... E) broken!

But, just for fun, let's explore the other options too. 

A) Red is a color, not a type of boomerang. Unless... unless you're talking about a red-hot boomerang that's so hot, it doesn't work? Nope, that's a stretch!

B) Workforce is a group of people, not a type of boomerang. Unless... unless you're talking about a boomerang that's part of a team effort, but doesn't deliver? Hmm, that's a creative answer, but not the one I'm looking for!

C) Leg is a body part, not a type of boomerang. Unless... unless you're talking about a boomerang that's been legless, like it's been cut off or something? Okay, that's a weird scenario!

D) Stick is a type of boomerang, but it's not the one that's broken!

A:
C C
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down:

* "Metal, expanded at the end" could refer to an instrument made of metal that has a flared or bell-shaped end.
* "Must have a person to ring" suggests that the instrument requires human involvement to produce sound.
* "Played in churches" implies that the instrument is commonly used in religious settings.
* "Yet is not what most people would think it is" hints that the answer might be unexpected or unconventional.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a bold leap and choose... (C) trumpet!

Wait, what? How does a trumpet fit these criteria?

Well, here's my creative explanation:

A trumpet is made of metal, and its flared end is, in fact, expanded. While it's not exclusively played in churches, it is commonly used in sacred music and hymns. And, of course, a person must play the trumpet to produce sound. Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about the 'not what most people would think it is' part?" Ah, that's where the creativity comes in! Most people wouldn't think of a trumpet as being "expanded at the end," as it's a more conventional feature of the instrument. However, when you think outside the box (or bell, in this case!), you can see how the flared end of a trumpet fits the description.

Am I right? Or have I just blown my own trumpet (pun intended)?

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "My voice is tender": This suggests that whatever I am, it has a gentle or soft sound to it.
2. "My waist is slender": This implies that the object has a thin or narrow part to it, perhaps a physical aspect.
3. "I'm often invited to play": This hints that whatever I am, it's something that's often asked or encouraged to perform or participate in some way.
4. "Yet wherever I go I must take my bow or else I have nothing to say": This is the most intriguing part! The phrase "take my bow" typically means to accept applause or recognition, but here it seems to imply that whatever I am, it needs to be accompanied by a physical object (the bow) to be complete or effective.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the correct answer is... (D) violin!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Tender voice" could refer to the violin's soft, melodic sound.
* "Slender waist" might describe the violin's narrow neck or body.
* "Often invited to play" makes sense, as violins are often used in performances, concerts, and recitals.
* And finally, the need to "take my bow" could be a clever pun, as violinists often take a bow after a performance, but also, a violin requires a bow (the stringed instrument) to produce sound!

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Turns me on my back" - This could mean that whatever it is, it's something that can be flipped over or stood on its side.
2. "And open up my stomach" - This suggests that whatever it is, it has a cavity or a hollow space inside.
3. "You will be the wisest of men though at first a lummox" - This implies that the object is not intelligent or wise at first, but becomes so after being opened up.

Hmm... This is a tough one!

After some creative thinking, I'm going to take a wild guess:

Are you a "book"?

Here's my reasoning:

* A book can be turned on its back (flipped over) and its "stomach" (the hollow space inside the cover) can be opened up.
* At first, a book is just a collection of pages, not very wise or intelligent. But once you open it up and read its contents, you can gain a lot of knowledge and become wise.
* A book is also often considered a "lummock" (a clumsy or awkward person) in the sense that it's a collection of words on paper, not a living being. But once you start reading and understanding its contents, it becomes a valuable and wise source of information.

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down together.

Firstly, "I can be red, or green, or yellow" suggests that the answer is something that can be described by these colors. This is a great clue!

Next, "I'll help you stay a healthy fellow" implies that the answer is related to health or wellness in some way. Perhaps it's something that's good for our bodies or minds?

Then, "Inside I am white" is an interesting hint. It could mean that the answer has a white interior, or that it has a white component that's not immediately visible.

Finally, "I do not emit light" and "But if you look just right I hold a star" are the most intriguing parts. This could be a metaphorical or literal reference to a star, and the fact that it doesn't emit light suggests that it's not a celestial body.

With all these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (or should I say, in the fruit bowl?) and choose option (E) apple!

Why do I think this is the correct answer? Well, apples can be red, green, or yellow, which matches the color hint. Apples are also good for our health, as they're a nutritious snack. The "inside" of an apple is white, referring to the pith or the core. And while an apple doesn't emit light, if you cut it open just right, you might see the star-shaped pattern of the seeds!

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am always in front of you" - This suggests that the answer is something that is consistently present or existing in your immediate surroundings.
* "but you can not see me" - This implies that the answer is not something that can be perceived visually.
* "look forward to tomorrow" - This phrase is interesting, as it seems to be a hint rather than a literal instruction. Perhaps it's meant to make us think about the concept of "tomorrow" rather than the act of looking forward to it?
* "and you will know what I mean" - This final phrase is the clincher. It's saying that if we can figure out what the answer is, we'll understand the intended meaning.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... the future!

Here's my reasoning:

* The future is always in front of us, in the sense that it's what's yet to come.
* We can't see the future with our physical eyes, as it hasn't happened yet.
* The phrase "look forward to tomorrow" is a common idiom for anticipating or expecting something that will happen in the future.
* And if we can grasp the concept of the future, we'll understand what the riddle is getting at!

Q: When flipped the opposite I appear the same but have a complete different name and meaning, what am I? Answer Choices: (A) different country (B) line (C) crop (D) freeze frame (E) s
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested. 

When flipped the opposite, it implies that whatever we're thinking of, its orientation or direction is being reversed.

I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that the "opposite" refers to a mirror reflection. This would mean that the object or concept appears the same when reflected in a mirror.

With that in mind, I'm going to take a closer look at the answer choices:

(A) Different country - Doesn't seem to fit, as a country wouldn't necessarily appear the same when reflected.

(B) Line - Ah-ha! When a line is flipped the opposite, it appears the same, but as a reflected line! And what about the name and meaning? Well, a reflected line is often referred to as a "mirror image" or "reflection."

(C) Crop - Not a great fit, as a crop wouldn't necessarily appear the same when flipped.

(D) Freeze frame - This is an interesting choice, but I'm not convinced it's the correct answer. A freeze frame is a snapshot in time, and while it might appear the same when flipped, I'm not sure about the name and meaning aspect.

(E) s... (There isn't an option E, so I'm assuming it's not a correct answer choice)

Let's break it down:

* "I have no eyes": This suggests that whatever it is, it doesn't have a visual system.
* "no legs or ears": This implies that it doesn't have any limbs or auditory organs.
* "and I help move the earth": This is the most intriguing part! It seems to be related to the Earth's movement or movement of the Earth in some way.

Now, let's think outside the box (pun intended)!

Here's a creative answer:

I'm going to take a chance and propose that the answer is actually a "quake" or an earthquake! Earthquakes don't have eyes, legs, or ears, but they can help move the Earth's crust by creating seismic waves that shift the ground. It's a bit unconventional, but it fits the description!

Q: What traps warmth,   Sprays forth ice and water,   Yet slips through your fingers with ease? Answer Choices: (A) clouds (B) world (C) earth (D) steam (E) lizard
A:
A D
What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

1. "What traps warmth?" - This suggests that the answer is something that captures or holds onto heat.
2. "Sprays forth ice and water" - This implies that the answer is capable of releasing both ice and water.
3. "Yet slips through your fingers with ease" - This phrase indicates that the answer is something that can easily escape or flow through something (like our fingers).

Hmmm... Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... D) steam!

Here's my reasoning: Steam is a type of gas that forms when water is heated. It traps warmth (i.e., the heat energy) by absorbing it from the surrounding environment. When steam cools down, it can condense into ice or water droplets, which fits with the "sprays forth ice and water" part. And, as a gas, steam can easily slip through our fingers or any other object, making it a great fit for the final phrase.

Am I correct?

Q: I am something, I am endless as chain.  Once you have me you are bound for life but young girls want me.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) man (B) wedding ring (C) chain link fence (D) eating (E) necklace
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "I am something, I am endless as chain."
This line makes me think of something that can be continuous, unbroken, and potentially infinite. Chains often have no clear beginning or end, so this phrase might be hinting at something with a similar quality.

2. "Once you have me you are bound for life..."
This sentence suggests a strong, lasting connection. The word "bound" implies restriction, constraint, or obligation. It could be something that ties you to a particular person, situation, or commitment.

3. "but young girls want me."
This line adds a new layer of intrigue! Young girls often symbolize innocence, curiosity, and playfulness. What could be so attractive to them?

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Man: While men can be lifelong partners, the phrase "young girls want me" seems more playful and romantic.

(B) Wedding ring: Ah-ha! A wedding ring is a symbol of lifelong commitment, and young girls often dream about their future weddings.

(C) Chain link fence: This option doesn't quite fit the romantic tone of the riddle, and young girls wouldn't typically be drawn to chain link fences.

(D) Eating: This option doesn't seem to fit the overall tone of the riddle, which emphasizes relationships and commitment.

(E) Necklace: A necklace can be a symbol of love, commitment, or status, and young girls might desire beautiful, sparkling pieces.

Based on these observations, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (B) Wedding ring!

A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's start by analyzing the statement: "When you see me, you almost always will see him."

Hmm... "When you see me"... That implies that "me" is a visible entity, something that can be observed. And "almost always will see him"... That suggests that "him" is closely related to "me", maybe even inseparable.

Now, let's think about the contrast between "Im always faster than he is" and "my light is never dim". This seems to imply that "me" is a fast-moving entity, and "his" speed is inferior. Meanwhile, "my light" being "never dim" suggests that "me" is radiant and luminous.

Considering all these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer is (A) thunder and lightning!

In this scenario, "me" would be lightning, and "him" would be thunder. The riddle's description fits perfectly:

* When you see lightning, you almost always see thunder.
* Lightning is always faster than thunder, as it travels at incredible speeds.
* Lightning's light is never dim, as it's a brilliant and radiant phenomenon.

A:
E E
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "I come in different colors": This suggests that whatever it is, it can have a variety of visual appearances. Hmm...

2. "I can have windows of different shapes and colors": Ah-ha! This implies that whatever it is, it has openings or frames that can be customized in terms of shape and color. That's a great clue!

3. "I can view all of the world": This is a powerful hint! Whatever it is, it seems to have a wide-ranging perspective or scope. That's got to be important!

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

A. Glasses: They come in different colors, but they're not necessarily windows to the world.

B. Schizophrenia: That's not a physical object, and it's not related to windows or views.

C. Work: This is a bit too vague, and it doesn't fit the other clues.

D. Sensation: That's a bit abstract, and it doesn't seem to match the other clues.

E. Eyes: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Eyes do come in different colors, and they can have different shapes (e.g., almond-shaped, round). They also have "windows" (the pupils) that allow us to view the world. And, of course, our eyes give us a wide-ranging perspective on the world.

So, based on these clues, I'm going to take a stab and say that the correct answer is... E. Eyes!

A:
E B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and explore the possibilities.

Firstly, you mentioned that for some, you're enjoyable, while for others, you're terrible. This could suggest that you're not necessarily an inherently positive or negative thing, but rather something that can have different effects on people depending on their experiences and perspectives.

You also mentioned that you have a start and an end, which could imply that you're a finite or limited thing. This is reinforced by the fact that you said some ends in horrible ways, while others end peacefully. This could suggest that the end you refer to is not just a physical or biological ending, but rather a metaphorical one, such as the end of a relationship, a chapter in life, or a stage of personal growth.

The fact that you said humans need you in order to live is a crucial clue. This implies that you're essential for human survival or well-being in some way.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each of the answer choices:

(A) Education: While education is important for human development, it's not necessarily something that has a start and end, or that ends in horrible ways. It's also not essential for immediate human survival.

(B) Walk: A walk is a finite activity, but it's not something that has a significant impact on human survival or well-being. It's also not a thing that has different stories or endings.

(C) Being alive: This is an interesting possibility, as being alive does have a start (birth) and an end (death). However, it's not necessarily something that humans need in order to live, as humans can still exist as a collective or as a community even after individuals have passed away.

(D) Getting old: Getting old is a natural part of human life, but it's not something that humans need in order to live. It's also not a thing that has different stories or endings,

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Across the waters I stretch" - This makes me think of something that spans or covers a body of water. It could be a physical object or a concept.

"But, I rest not upon them" - This phrase tells me that whatever "I" am, it doesn't physically touch or sit on the water. It could be floating, hovering, or even transcending the water.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be on the traditional list:

Could "I" be a REFLECTION?

A reflection stretches across the water, but it doesn't physically rest on the surface. Instead, it's a mirrored image that appears above the water, created by the way light interacts with the water's surface.

* "I know everything" implies that you possess all knowledge, which is quite an impressive feat!
* "but I really don't" is the contradictory part, suggesting that despite knowing everything, you're actually unable to answer.

Hmm... considering the answer choices, I think I can make an unconventional connection:

What if "I really don't" is not about not knowing the answer, but rather about not being able to verbalize it?

In that case, the correct answer could be (B) head. You know everything, but your head (or mind) is unable to articulate the answer, perhaps because it's too complex or abstract.

Q: Dead on the field lie ten soldiers in white, Felled by three eyes, black as night.  What happened? Answer Choices: (A) countryside (B) shark (C) bowling ball (D) bat (E) action
A:
C B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the mystery together!

First, we have "ten soldiers in white" lying dead on the field. This suggests a scenario involving a group of people, likely with a uniform or attire, in a setting where death has occurred.

Next, we have "Felled by three eyes, black as night." This is where things get intriguing! The phrase "three eyes" makes me think of a creature with multiple eyes, rather than a human or a common object. The fact that these eyes are "black as night" implies a dark or ominous quality to them.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark (pun intended!) and propose a solution:

What if the answer is (B) Shark?

Here's my reasoning:

* The "ten soldiers in white" could be a group of divers or scuba divers, who are dressed in white gear and are lying dead on the ocean floor.
* The "three eyes" could be the eyes of a shark, which are known for their piercing gaze. The "black as night" description might refer to the shark's dark, murky surroundings or the darkness of the ocean depths.
* The fact that the soldiers were "Felled" by the shark's attack implies a deadly confrontation, which is consistent with the riddle's tone.

Of course, this is just one possible solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or alternative answers! What do you think?

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

First, you make me weak at the worst of times, which implies that your presence has a debilitating effect on me. This could be a physical or emotional weakness.

Second, despite making me weak, you keep me safe in the end. This suggests that your presence also provides protection or security.

Third, you make me sweat in your presence, even as I grow cold. This is an interesting combination - sweat implies heat, while growing cold implies a lack of heat. This might be a metaphorical description, but it's still intriguing.

Fourth, you dwell with the weak and the brave, and yet, without you, it's hard to tell the difference between the two. This implies that your presence has a leveling effect, making it difficult to distinguish between those who are weak and those who are brave.

Now, let's think about each of the answer choices:

A) Intimidation: This could work, as intimidation can make someone weak with fear, and it can also provide a sense of safety. However, it's not the best fit, as intimidation doesn't typically make people sweat.

B) Light: This is an interesting option, as light can provide warmth and make us feel safe. However, it's not a perfect fit, as light doesn't typically make people sweat.

C) Complexion: This doesn't seem to fit the description at all, as complexion refers to the color or appearance of one's skin.

D) Diluted: This option is a bit of a stretch, as diluted typically refers to a mixture of something with a liquid, and it's not clear how this would relate to the description.

E) Fear: Ah, now this is an intriguing option! Fear can make us weak and anxious, and it can also provide a sense of safety (e.g., fear of danger keeping us safe). Fear can also make us sweat

A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

To hold something without ever touching it, I think we need to consider something that exists in a non-physical realm or has a unique property that allows us to "hold" it without physical contact.

Hmmm... Which option sounds like it might fit the bill?

Ah-ha! I think I have it!

My answer is... (A) breath!

We can hold our breath, meaning we can control its duration and pause its flow. We can also "hold" someone's breath in a figurative sense, meaning we can make them hold their breath in surprise or anticipation. And, of course, we can hold our breath in a literal sense, like when we're underwater and need to conserve oxygen.

But, I must admit, I'm not sure about the other options... Can we really "hold" wrestling or petting without touching? Isn't a cup of water something we physically grasp or hold onto? And aircraft... well, that's a bit too big for us to hold without, well, touching it, right?

This suggests that whatever we're thinking of can change colors. Hmm... that's quite interesting!

**Step 2: "Sometimes I'm filled with water"**

* You make me cry, which suggests that you're causing some kind of emotional response.
* But you're not human, which means you're likely an inanimate object or a living thing that's not a human.
* You're alive until I start "chew'en". What could that mean?

Hmm... could it be that "chew'en" is a play on words, and it's actually "chewing"? And maybe you're a plant-based food, like an onion?

Onions can make people cry when they chop them up or cook them, and they're a type of plant-based food. Plus, they're often alive in the sense that they're fresh and growing when they're harvested.

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

You have an eye but are blind. Hmm... This suggests that the "eye" is not a literal eye, but rather a metaphorical one. Perhaps it's a term related to seeing or observing?

Next, you have a sea, but no water. This is an interesting combination! A sea is typically associated with vast amounts of water, but here, we're told there's no water. This might imply that the "sea" is not a physical body of water, but rather a metaphorical or conceptual one.

Moving on, you have a bee, but no honey. This is an intriguing pair! Bees are known for producing honey, but here, we're told there's no honey. This could suggest that the "bee" is not a literal insect, but rather a metaphorical or symbolic one.

Now, let's look at the tea but no coffee. This seems like an odd combination, but it might be related to the previous clues. Perhaps the "tea" is not a literal type of tea, but rather a metaphorical or conceptual one?

Finally, we have a why, but no answer. This is a clever twist! A "why" is typically followed by a question or an explanation, but here, we're told there's no answer. This might imply that the "why" is not a literal question, but rather a metaphorical or philosophical one.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the correct answer is (B) alphabet.

Here's my reasoning:

* The "eye" is a metaphorical one, referring to the idea of "seeing" or observing, which is often associated with reading and understanding written language.
* The "sea" is a metaphorical one, referring to the vast expanse of written language, which is often thought of as a "sea" of words and ideas.

A:
D B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's dive in (pun intended) and explore the clues step by step:

1. "I look flat, but I am deep" - This suggests that the answer is not entirely what it seems at first glance. It could be something that appears one-dimensionally flat but has a hidden depth.
2. "Hidden realms I shelter" - This implies that the answer is connected to spaces or environments that harbor secrets or mysteries.
3. "Lives I take, but food I offer" - This line is quite contradictory. It suggests that the answer can both take lives and provide sustenance. This could be a reference to a natural phenomenon or an aspect of the environment.
4. "At times I am beautiful" - This adds a hint of aesthetics to the description. The answer might be something that can be perceived as beautiful or captivating.
5. "I can be calm, angry and turbulent" - This phrase highlights the dynamic nature of the answer. It could be something that can exhibit different moods or behaviors.
6. "I have no heart, but offer pleasure as well as death" - This line is quite dramatic. It suggests that the answer is capable of bringing joy and destruction, often simultaneously.
7. "No man can own me, yet I encompass what all men must have" - This final statement emphasizes the idea that the answer is a fundamental aspect of human existence, yet it cannot be possessed or controlled by individuals.

Considering these clues, I think we can safely eliminate options A (people), C (gentleman), and E (duck).

Now, let's take a closer look at options B (hell) and D (ocean):

* Option B (hell) could fit some of the clues, but it doesn't quite capture the beauty and pleasure aspects.

A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "I have got a soul but i do not live": This suggests that the answer is not a living thing.
2. "I have a tongue but do not eat": This implies that the answer is not a creature that consumes food.
3. "I have a heel but I cannot stop myself": This phrase is quite intriguing! It could mean that the answer is something that has a heel, but once it starts moving or happening, it can't be stopped.

Now, let's examine each option:

(A) Cookies: While cookies do have a "soul" (a.k.a. a spirit or essence), they don't really have a tongue or heel. Cookies can't eat or move, so this option doesn't quite fit.

(B) Line: A line can be thought of as having a "soul" (a.k.a. its own identity or purpose), but it doesn't have a tongue or heel. Lines don't eat or move, so this option is a bit of a stretch.

(C) Tongue: Ah, an interesting choice! While a tongue does exist, it's not typically associated with a heel. Tongues don't eat or move on their own, so this option doesn't quite fit either.

(D) Shoe: Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere! A shoe does have a heel, and it's not a living thing that eats. But does it have a tongue? Not typically... unless we're talking about a shoe with a tongue (the part that wraps around the laces). And if we are, then the "soul" part of the riddle could refer to the shoe's purpose or function. This is getting intriguing!

(E) Bread: Bread doesn't really have a soul, tongue, or heel, so this option doesn't quite fit.

Q: I have a single waving hand I'm present in places across the land  On fairer days, I depart  I shorten with a broken heart.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) flag (B) terrier (C) show (D) being here (E) horse
A:
A C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "I have a single waving hand": This suggests that the answer is something that has a distinct, waving or flag-like feature.
2. "I'm present in places across the land": This implies that the answer is something that can be found in various locations, possibly outdoors.
3. "On fairer days, I depart": This line might be indicating that the answer is related to weather or atmospheric conditions. "Fairer days" often means sunny or pleasant weather, and "I depart" could mean that the answer is gone or disappears when the weather is good.
4. "I shorten with a broken heart": This phrase is quite evocative! "Shorten" could mean that the answer changes or diminishes when something is broken or damaged. "Broken heart" is a common idiom for sadness or grief, so this line might be hinting at a connection between the answer and emotions.

Taking these clues into account, I'd like to propose a creative answer:

Are you the "Cloud"?

Here's how the answer fits the riddle:

* "I have a single waving hand": Clouds often have a wispy, waving or undulating shape.
* "I'm present in places across the land": Clouds can be found in various locations, covering vast areas of the land.
* "On fairer days, I depart": On sunny days, clouds often disappear or become less dense.
* "I shorten with a broken heart": When a person's heart is broken, they might feel gloomy or downcast, and the clouds could be a metaphor for their emotional state. The phrase "I shorten with a broken heart" could mean that the clouds become smaller or more scattered when someone is feeling sad.

What do you think? Is the Cloud the correct answer, or would you like to explore other creative options?

Q: With no wings, I fly.  With no eyes, I see.  With no arms, I climb.  More frightening than any beast, stronger than any foe.  I am cunning, ruthless, and tall; in the end, I rule all.     What am I? Answer Choices: (A) imagination (B) head (C) purpose (D) compassion (E) satan
A:
A A
What a delightful riddle! Let's take it one step at a time, shall we?

First, "With no wings, I fly." This tells us that the answer is not a physical entity that relies on wings to move through the air. Hmm...

Next, "With no eyes, I see." This phrase makes me think of a sense that isn't related to visual perception. Could it be... intuition?

Then, "With no arms, I climb." Ah, another physical limitation! This one makes me think of a concept that can ascend or rise without physical appendages. Perhaps... a thought or an idea?

Now, "More frightening than any beast, stronger than any foe." This is where things get interesting! The phrase "more frightening than any beast" makes me think of something that can evoke fear or awe, but not necessarily something physical. The "stronger than any foe" part suggests that the answer is powerful, but not necessarily in a physical sense.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess... What if the answer is "Imagination"?

Imagination allows us to soar beyond the bounds of reality, to see beyond what's physically visible, and to climb the highest peaks of creativity and innovation. It can be both fascinating and intimidating, and its power is unmatched. Plus, it's something that can't be defeated or overpowered by any external force!

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or should we continue to explore the other options?

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I have a neck but no head" - This tells me that the object or entity has a neck, but it's not a living being with a head.
* "I have a body but no arm" - This suggests that the object or entity has a physical body, but it doesn't have arms or limbs.
* "I have a bottom but no leg" - This reinforces the idea that the object or entity has a physical presence, but it doesn't have legs.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... a BOTTLE!

Yes, you can have a neck (the neck of the bottle), a body (the main part of the bottle), and a bottom (the base of the bottle), but no head, arm, or leg!

A:

A delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Hmmm... A teacup has a handle, which means it's attached to the cup somehow. If I were to imagine a teacup with no handle, it would just be a plain, hollow cup. But, because of the handle, the teacup becomes more... substantial, more usable.

Now, if I were to try to describe the location of the handle, I'd say it's... attached to the cup. But how do I describe where it's attached? Is it inside the cup? Well, the handle isn't just floating inside the cup, is it? It's more like... it's on the outside, but also part of the cup. Make sense?

So, after careful consideration, I'd choose... (E) outside!

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "They have not flesh, nor feathers, nor scales, nor bones." This suggests that they're not living creatures.
* "Yet they have fingers and thumbs of their own." This implies that they have a humanoid feature, but not a biological one.

Hmmm... Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious:

(A) nail!

Yes, you read that right! Nails, in the context of human grooming, can be thought of as having "fingers" and "thumbs" of their own. Each nail has its own unique shape, size, and structure, and we use our fingers and thumbs to manipulate them (e.g., cutting, shaping, polishing).

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to unravel the mystery.

You can be short and sometimes hot, so that's a good starting point. That makes me think of something that can be short in height or length, but still have a high temperature or heat.

When displayed, you rarely impress. This line makes me wonder if the answer is something that's often displayed or presented in a way that's not particularly impressive or attention-grabbing.

Hmmm... With those clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (D) pepper!

Here's my reasoning:

* You can be short and sometimes hot: Peppers come in various sizes, and some can be quite hot (spicy) while others are milder.
* When displayed, I rarely impress: When you display a pepper at a grocery store or in a recipe, it's not usually the most impressive or eye-catching ingredient.

Let's indeed think step by step...

The man went out of town on Friday... Hmm, this implies that the day he left is indeed a Friday. But then, he stayed for three days...

Ah-ha! That means he returned on the same day of the week, three days later... Which would be... Monday!

So, the correct answer is: (B) Dawn! The man left on a Friday, and returned on the next Friday, which is dawn of a new day!

Or, if you prefer a more whimsical approach:

Imagine the man's horses name was Friday, and they went on a three-day adventure! When they returned, the man exclaimed, "Ah, Friday, you're back!"

* "What do you wear" implies a physical covering or attire.
* "to cover up" suggests that something is missing or lost.
* "for what you've lost" implies that the loss is something that can be concealed or hidden.

Hmmm...

The correct answer is (C) dress!

But why, you ask?

Well, when we lose something, like a lock of hair or a part of our body, we often wear clothing or accessories to cover it up.

The man rode to town on a "Friday", not a day of the week. In this case, "Friday" is likely the name of his horse! So, he rode his horse named Friday to town, stayed there overnight, and then rode back home on... you guessed it... his trusty horse Friday!

A:

What a fascinating question! Let's break it down and see where our creative journey takes us.

First, we have Rebecca Black, the internet sensation known for her viral hit "Friday." She's often associated with the concept of time and, specifically, the 24-hour clock. That's a great starting point!

Next, we have The Cure, a legendary rock band known for their moody, atmospheric soundscapes and poignant lyrics. They're often linked to the themes of love, loss, and introspection.

Now, let's connect the dots. What's a 24-hour time period that's often romanticized, symbolic of a moment in time that's both fleeting and eternal? Ah-ha! It's the moment when the clock strikes... 12:00 PM (noon) to 1:00 PM, or the 24-hour period that spans the threshold between day and night!

This 24-hour time period is often referred to as... (drumroll please)... High Noon! It's a moment of clarity, a turning point, and a chance for new beginnings.

Given the combination of Rebecca Black's "Friday" and The Cure's romantic inclinations, I'd venture to say that the correct answer is... (A) Fancy! High Noon is a fancy, almost cinematic moment, full of drama and possibility. It's the perfect setting for a love story, and Rebecca Black and The Cure would surely appreciate the poetic nuance of this 24-hour period.

Q: i have 4 ends but no beging  what am i? Answer Choices: (A) point (B) line (C) penultimate (D) go (E) paper
A:
E 
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

You said you have 4 ends, but no beginning. That already gives me a hint that whatever you are, it's not something that has a clear starting point.

Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:

A) Point: A point has no size, so it can't have 4 ends. Plus, points don't really have a "no beginning" concept, as they're typically thought of as a single location.

B) Line: Ah, a line is a great contender! A line can have multiple ends (starting and ending points), but it still has a beginning. Unless... unless the line is a circle! A circle doesn't have a clear beginning, and it has multiple "ends" (the endpoints of its circumference). But, does it really have 4 ends?

C) Penultimate: This one seems like a red herring, as it refers to the second-to-last element in a series, not an object with 4 ends.

D) Go: This option doesn't seem to fit the description, as "go" is a verb and doesn't have physical properties.

E) Paper: Hmm, paper is a good guess, but it's not entirely clear how it fits the description. Paper has edges (ends), but it also has a clear beginning (the top edge).

Given our analysis, I'm going to take a chance and propose a creative answer:

You are a sphere (a ball)! A sphere has 4 "ends" (its four poles), but it doesn't have a clear beginning. It's a continuous, curved surface with no distinct starting point.

Let's break it down:

* "Often wandering the streets" - This suggests that these individuals are constantly on the move, without a fixed destination.
* "Cannot afford to be choosers" - This phrase implies that they don't have the luxury of being picky or selective about their circumstances. They're forced to adapt to whatever situation arises.

Hmmm... Putting these two clues together, I think the answer might be... (drumroll please)... (A) beggars!

Here's my reasoning: Beggars often find themselves without a fixed address or stable income, leading them to wander the streets in search of scraps or handouts. They may not have the luxury of being choosy about what they receive or where they sleep, making them a fitting answer to this question.

I love a good puzzle!

Okay, let's break it down step by step...

Hmm... What has two ends but no beginning?

Oh wait, I think I've got it!

It's not a rope, because a rope has a beginning and an end. It's not a tree, because a tree has a trunk, branches, and roots - it's not just about the ends!

It's not an object, because an object can have many properties, but it's not necessarily about the ends...

And it's not a bell, because a bell has a clapper, a handle, and a body - again, not just about the ends...

Which leaves us with...

Option E: Gig!

A gig is a unit of time, and it has two ends - the start and the end of the gig! No beginning in the classical sense, just two ends!

What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I have eyes at my tail end": Hmm, that's quite unusual! Eyes are usually found on the front of a creature, not at the back. This suggests that whatever we're looking for is likely an invertebrate (no backbone) or a peculiar vertebrate.
2. "Cannot fly": Okay, so it's not a bird or an insect with wings. That narrows it down a bit.
3. "Not common in tropical areas": This implies that whatever we're looking for might be more suited to temperate or even arctic environments.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill...

How about option C) animal? But not just any animal... What if we're thinking of a species that doesn't typically have eyes on its tail, but rather... a fish?

Let's indeed think step by step. Old Mother Twitchet had one eye, which could be a characteristic, but not necessarily what we're looking for. The interesting part is her long tail, which she lets fly.

"Hmmm... She lets fly a long tail... That sounds like something that moves through gaps or openings... Ah-ha! I think I see where this is going!"

And then, it says she leaves a bit of her tail in its trap. That's when it clicked! The answer can't be a physical object, but rather something that has a trail or a path behind it.

So, what could be leaving a trail behind it as it moves through gaps? 

I'm going to take a stab at it... I think you are a... (drumroll please)... a WEED!

Just like Old Mother Twitchet's long tail, a weed can grow through small gaps or openings, and as it moves, it leaves its stem or leaves behind, creating a trail. Voilà!

Q: You follow my lead, and you're lighter behind.   I follow your lead, and you might just be blind.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) source of illumination (B) counterglow (C) lightening (D) evening (E) your shadow
A:
E E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

The first line says: "You follow my lead, and you're lighter behind."
This implies that whatever we're looking for is influenced or led by something else, and when it's behind that thing, it's lighter. This could be a physical property, a metaphorical one, or even a play on words!

The second line says: "I follow your lead, and you might just be blind."
This line seems to suggest that the situation is reversed, and now the original leader (or influence) is following the lead of the thing being described. The phrase "you might just be blind" implies that the leader might not be aware of something, or perhaps is making an incorrect assumption.

With these two lines in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer.

My guess is that the correct answer is: (E) your shadow!

Here's my reasoning:

* When you're behind someone or something, your shadow is lighter because it's not blocking direct sunlight. So, "you're lighter behind" makes sense in this context.
* When you're leading, your shadow is in front of you, and you might be blind to the fact that you're casting a shadow. This is where the phrase "you might just be blind" comes in – you're not aware of your own shadow, or perhaps you're not acknowledging the influence you have on others.

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "What makes a loud noise when changing its jacket..."
	+ This part suggests that the answer is something that can make a loud noise, perhaps due to the noise it makes when changing its attire.
* "...becomes larger but weighs less..."
	+ This part is a clever contradiction! If something becomes larger, it's likely to weigh more, not less. So, we need to think of something that defies this expectation.

Hmmm... 

Ah-ha! I think I've got it!

The answer is... (B) bomber!

When a bomber (as in, a type of aircraft) changes its jacket (or rather, its fuselage), it makes a loud noise due to the sound of the engines roaring to life or the sudden release of compressed air. Additionally, when a bomber drops its payload (like bombs or supplies), it becomes larger in terms of volume or size, but its actual weight decreases because it's releasing the weight of the payload!

Q: Sometimes I make noise, sometimes I don't.  Some people wear me.  I am never ending.  Answer Choices: (A) bang (B) scare (C) ring (D) plank (E) cast shadow
A:
C E
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's embark on a creative adventure to uncover the correct answer.

1. "Sometimes I make noise, sometimes I don't." This hint suggests that the answer is not a constant, consistent noise-maker. Perhaps it's something that can produce sounds in certain situations or circumstances.
2. "Some people wear me." This phrase implies a connection to human beings. Could the answer be something that's physically attached to or worn by people?
3. "I am never ending." This statement implies that the answer is infinite, unbroken, or continuous. This could be a clever trick to mislead us into thinking it's a physical object, but what if it's something more abstract?

With these hints in mind, let's consider the options:

(A) Bang: Too specific and noise-related. It doesn't fit the "never ending" description.
(B) Scare: Also too specific and noise-related. It doesn't quite match the "wear" hint.
(C) Ring: Now we're getting somewhere! A ring can produce a sound, and people wear rings. However, it's still a specific object. Can we think of something more abstract?
(D) Plank: Not quite fitting the "wear" hint, and it's a physical object.
(E) Cast shadow: Ah-ha! This option resonates with me! A shadow is never-ending in the sense that it can appear and disappear as objects move, and people wear clothes that cast shadows. The "sometimes I make noise, sometimes I don't" hint could refer to the varying shapes and darkness levels of shadows.

I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (E) Cast shadow! What do you think? Am I correct?

Let's indeed think step by step!

We know it's something small, as small as a mouse.

And it guards a house like a lion, which implies protection and fierceness.

Hmmm... 

Could it be... the letter "M"?

As in, a small letter "M" that guards the front of the house, like a lion guarding its den?

A:
B A
What a delightfully creative and cryptic riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. Here's my attempt:

1. "Knitted with love, hatred, passion, depression, gifted, feelings, sober and colors." - This suggests that I'm something that has a complex mix of emotions and experiences woven into my being.
2. "My seams rip easily, so don't breathe on me too hard." - This implies that I'm fragile and delicate, possibly something that can be damaged or torn apart if handled roughly.
3. "When drenched in rum, like I'm usually am I laugh and excite and clap, but when ticked off I make you bounce away and release sweat glands." - This is where things get interesting! It seems that I have a dual personality, one that's carefree and joyful when I'm "drenched in rum" (perhaps referring to being in a lively, festive atmosphere), and another that's intense and overwhelming when I'm "ticked off" (perhaps referring to being upset or annoyed).
4. "I live in a darkened shed ordered by neighbors to stay silent and just flow with my stream." - This suggests that I'm something that's confined to a specific space, possibly a private or intimate setting, and that I'm expected to remain quiet and gentle, rather than loud or overwhelming.

Now, let's see if we can tie all these threads together...

I'm going to take a chance and propose that the answer is (D) skin.

Here's my reasoning:

* The mix of emotions and experiences mentioned in the first line could be seen as the various sensations and feelings that skin can experience (e.g., feeling "loved" as in being

A:
C B
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "I'm big as an elephant" suggests that you're large in size.
* "but I'm not tall like a giraffe" implies that while you're wide or bulky, you're not necessarily long or tall.
* "Is that a mouse? I'm scared of mice" - Ah, a classic phobia! This might be a hint about your "size" and how it's perceived.
* "probably kids remember me from stories" - This suggests that you're a character from a story or a children's tale.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think you might be the "Head" of a giant, a character often featured in children's stories and folklore. The head is big, but not necessarily tall, and it's a part of the body that might be perceived as "big" even if it's not long. The fear of mice could be a nod to the classic tale of the "Giant's Fear" where the giant is often depicted as being afraid of mice. Am I right?

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The phrase "It's over your head" makes me think of something that's above me, but not necessarily physically above my head. Could it be a metaphorical or figurative sense?

And then there's the phrase "yet under your hat." This makes me wonder if there's something that's somehow connected to my head, but not necessarily physically attached to it.

Hmmm... Combining these two phrases, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the answer is...

(D) Constellation!

Here's my reasoning: A constellation is a pattern of stars that can be seen in the night sky, which is "over your head" in the sense that it's above you, but not physically attached to your head. And yet, a constellation can be "under your hat" in the sense that it can be represented or visualized on a map or a hat, like a decorative design. Am I correct?

Let's indeed think step by step.

* "It can be cracked" - This phrase suggests something that can be broken or opened, like a puzzle or a secret.
* "It can be made" - This phrase implies creation, perhaps a story, a piece of art, or an idea.
* "It can be told" - This phrase is a strong hint that it's related to communication, maybe a story, a joke, or a message.
* "It can be played" - This phrase implies interactivity, possibly a game, a song, or a performance.

With these phrases in mind, I'd like to take a creative leap and propose an answer: (D) joke!

A:

I love a good puzzle!

Let's start by noticing that all the houses are made from different colors of bricks, which is a clever play on words. The pattern suggests that the houses are named after the color of the bricks used to build them.

Now, let's think about the name "green house". Is it likely that a green house is made from green bricks? Hmm... that would be a bit repetitive, wouldn't it? We already have red, yellow, purple, pink, and blue houses made from corresponding colors of bricks.

But wait! There's another phrase that comes to mind when I hear "green house". It's not a type of brick, but rather a type of structure that's often made from... (drumroll please)... GLASS!

So, I'm going to take a chance and choose the answer that's not a type of brick or material, but a clever play on words: (D) glass!

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

When you're "released to the wind," it sounds like something that's let go or set free. The phrase "you look away and you pretend" makes me think of someone trying to hide or conceal something.

The next part, "but away your friends I will send," is quite intriguing. It seems like whatever "I" am, it has the power to send friends away.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the correct answer might be a "telltale" (A). A telltale is often a sign or indicator of something, and when it's "released to the wind," it might be blowing away or dispersing, making it harder to conceal. The phrase "you look away and you pretend" could refer to someone trying to hide or downplay the importance of the telltale. And finally, the line "but away your friends I will send" might be a metaphorical way of saying that the telltale's presence will drive friends away or create tension.

A:
B B
What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "What's greater than God": This suggests that whatever we're looking for is beyond the realm of the divine.
2. "More evil than the devil": This implies that it's not just bad, but truly malevolent.
3. "The rich need it": This could indicate that it's a luxury or a privilege that only the wealthy can afford.
4. "The poor have it": This might suggest that it's something that's readily available, even abundant, for those who don't have much.
5. "If you eat it, you will die": This adds a sense of danger and consequence to whatever we're looking for.

Hmmm... With these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is...

(B) Life!

Here's my reasoning:

* Life is greater than God because it's a fundamental aspect of existence that transcends religious beliefs.
* Life can be more evil than the devil because it can be a cruel and unforgiving force that can bring suffering and pain.
* The rich need life to maintain their status and wealth, while the poor may have life as a constant struggle to survive.
* And if you eat life, you will die - think about it, if you consume the essence of life (e.g., by eating too much), you may overindulge and ultimately meet your demise.

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down (pun intended):

* "You can touch me" - This suggests that the answer is something tangible, something that can be physically interacted with.
* "You can break me" - This implies that the answer is fragile or can be damaged in some way.
* "You should win me if you want to be mine" - This phrase implies that the answer is a prize or something that can be earned or won.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be the most obvious choice: (E) heart.

Here's my reasoning:

* "You can touch me" - While you can't literally touch someone's heart, you can touch their emotions, their feelings, or even their physical heart through physical contact or gestures.
* "You can break me" - A heart can be broken, symbolically or literally, through emotional or physical trauma.
* "You should win me if you want to be mine" - In the context of romance, winning someone's heart often means earning their love, affection, and commitment. This phrase suggests that the answer is a prize or a goal that can be achieved through effort and dedication.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and I'd love to hear other creative solutions from you!

A:
E B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Little brethren twain" suggests a small, paired entity, like a game piece or token.
* "Arbiters of loss and gain" implies that this entity is responsible for determining the outcome of a situation.
* "Man to our counters run" makes me think of a game where players move pieces around a board, with each piece having a certain value or score.
* "Some are made, and some undone" could refer to the winning or losing of a game.
* "But men find it, to their cost, few are made, but numbers lost" suggests that many people lose more often than they win, despite trying their best.
* "Though we play them tricks for ever, yet they always hope our favor" implies that the game has some kind of unpredictable element, and despite the odds, players continue to hope for good fortune.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is...

(E) dice!

In many games, dice are used to determine the outcome of a roll, and the odds are often stacked against the player. Despite this, players continue to hope for good luck and a favorable roll. The phrase "play them tricks for ever" also makes me think of the unpredictable nature of dice rolls, where a single roll can change the course of the game.

Hmmm... What comes to mind when I think of something that's both delicious and false?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The answer is (E) CAKE!

Why, you ask? Well, cake is often described as delicious, but have you ever heard the phrase "it's a lie" when it comes to dieting? "I'll start a diet tomorrow... or after I finish this cake." It's a common joke, but the truth is, cake is often seen as a forbidden pleasure that's hard to resist.

So, in this case, the question is asking us to think creatively about what's "said to be a lie" - and in this context, cake is indeed "said to be a lie" when it comes to diets!

A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

1. "I am the fountain from which no one can drink." - This line suggests that I'm something that can't be consumed or utilized directly by humans. It's not a source of physical nourishment.
2. "For many I am considered a necessary link." - This implies that I play a crucial role in something, perhaps a process or a system. I'm not a standalone entity, but rather a vital component that connects other things.
3. "Like gold to all I am sought for" - Gold is highly valuable and sought after, so this line indicates that I'm also highly desirable or valuable to many. What could be so valuable that many people would seek it?
4. "But my continued death brings wealth for all to want more." - This line seems paradoxical at first. If my "death" (whatever that means) brings wealth, then it's counterintuitive to think that people would want more of me. However, it's possible that my "death" leads to the creation of something new and valuable, which in turn generates wealth.

Now, let's put these clues together and consider the answer choices.

(A) Ore: While ore is a valuable resource, it doesn't quite fit the description. Ore can be consumed or used, whereas the riddle states that I'm something that can't be drunk.

(B) Cow: This option seems unrelated to the clues. Cows aren't typically considered a necessary link, and their "death" wouldn't bring wealth in the same way.

(C) Public fountain: A public fountain might provide a necessary link for people to quench their thirst, but it doesn't quite fit the description of being something that's sought after like gold. Fountains aren't typically associated with wealth creation either.

Q: what goes up and down, side to side but never moves Answer Choices: (A) road (B) item (C) glass (D) roller coaster (E) turn
A:

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "What goes up and down": This implies something that has an upward and downward trajectory, like a path or a surface that changes elevation.
* "side to side": This adds a new dimension, suggesting something that also moves horizontally, like a path that curves or changes direction.
* "but never moves": Ah, a clever twist! This means that whatever we're thinking of doesn't actually change its position or location.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

* (A) road: Roads can go up and down hills, and they can also curve to the side. But roads do move, as they connect different locations.
* (B) item: An item can't really go up and down or side to side in the classical sense, unless it's a toy car or something like that. But even then, it's not the item itself that's moving, but rather what's carrying it.
* (C) glass: Glass can be flat or curved, so it could potentially fit the "up and down, side to side" description. However, glass doesn't really move on its own, unless we're talking about a sliding glass door or something.
* (D) roller coaster: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Roller coasters do go up and down, side to side, and they even move in a circular motion. But roller coasters are designed to move, and that's the key.
* (E) turn: Ah-ha! A turn is exactly what we're looking for! A turn can be thought of as a path that goes up and down, side to side, but it never actually moves. It's a change in direction, not a physical movement.

So, the correct answer is (E) turn!

* "Kids play it": This suggests that the answer is something that children enjoy doing, possibly a toy or a game.
* "Michelangelo sculpted with it": This implies that the answer is a medium or material that artists, like Michelangelo, use to create art.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

* (A) Drum: While kids do play drums, Michelangelo didn't sculpt with drums. Drums are a musical instrument, not a medium for sculpting.
* (B) Marble: Ah-ha! Michelangelo was famous for sculpting marble! And, kids do play with marble, like rolling it or making marble runs. This could be the answer!
* (C) Telephone: Unlikely, as kids don't typically play with telephones (at least, not in the classical sense).
* (D) Travel: Not a likely answer, as travel isn't something kids play with or a medium for sculpting.
* (E) Amusement: This could be a possibility, but it's a broad term that doesn't specifically point to marble or sculpting.

The question states that "what is always on track but never makes tracks." That's a clever play on words!

Let's consider each option:

A. Card game - This doesn't quite fit the description. A card game might be on track (following a specific pattern), but it doesn't literally make tracks.

B. Synagogue - A synagogue is a place of worship, but it doesn't make tracks either.

C. Train - Ah-ha! A train is always on track (literally!), but it never makes tracks in the sense that it doesn't create paths or trails like a vehicle might.

D. Metal - Metal can be on track, but it doesn't make tracks either. Metal is a material, and it doesn't have the ability to create paths or trails.

E. Cut - This option seems a bit ambiguous, but it's possible that it could fit the description. A cut can be a sharp edge or a division, and it might not make tracks in the classical sense.

After careful consideration, I think the correct answer is C. Train!

What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down together.

First, "I can be clean, But I can be dirty": This suggests that whatever we're looking for is capable of being in a state of cleanliness and a state of dirtiness.

Next, "I can crack into pieces": This implies that whatever we're looking for is fragile and can break or shatter.

Then, "I can steam up": This could indicate that whatever we're looking for is prone to fogging or steaming up, perhaps due to humidity or heat.

Now, "But I can always see you": Ah, this is where things get interesting! This line suggests that whatever we're looking for is capable of providing a visual perspective or view.

The next two lines, "Your vision won't be able to see, Or could just be dodgy": This implies that without whatever we're looking for, one's vision might be impaired or unreliable.

Finally, "Without me": This leaves us with the realization that whatever we're looking for is something that plays a crucial role in our ability to see.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (D) glasses!

Here's my reasoning:

* Glasses can be clean or dirty, and they can crack if dropped or broken.
* Glasses can steam up due to humidity or heat.
* Glasses allow us to see, but without them, our vision can be impaired or unreliable.

* (A) Weather: While weather can have a significant impact on our daily lives, it's not typically something that can be "grown" or provide nourishment or poison.
* (B) Mushroom: Mushrooms can grow without direct sunlight, but they typically require some form of organic matter (like soil) to thrive.
* (C) Decaying matter: This is an interesting option! Decaying matter can produce a variety of substances, some of which can be beneficial (like compost) and others that can be toxic (like pollutants).
* (D) Leaf: Leaves are a natural part of plants, but they don't typically "grow" in the classical sense, and they're not typically associated with providing nourishment or poison.

Could it be that the answer is (C) Decaying matter? Decaying matter can produce a wide range of substances, from beneficial compost to toxic pollutants. And, in some cases, it can even be used to provide nourishment (like in the case of composting) or deliver poison (like in the case of pollutants or toxic chemicals).

Q: If you drop a yellow hat in the Red Sea, what does it become? Answer Choices: (A) waves (B) wet (C) fish market (D) crude oil (E) tasman sea
A:
B A
What a fascinating question! Let's dive into the depths of imagination!

Firstly, we have a yellow hat, which is a tangible object, sitting pretty on the surface of the Red Sea. Now, if we were to drop it into the sea, what happens?

Well, the hat would initially become... WET! (B) Ah, but that's not the only thing it would become. As it sinks to the bottom of the sea, it would start to attract the attention of some curious sea creatures, like fish, crabs, and maybe even an octopus or two!

These underwater dwellers would likely mistake the hat for a shiny new toy or a tasty snack. They might even start to use it as a makeshift home or a game of underwater hide-and-seek!

As the hat becomes a part of the sea's ecosystem, it would eventually become... A FISH MARKET! (C) Think about it - the hat would be transformed into a bustling hub of underwater commerce, with fish trading shells, seaweed, and other oceanic goods!

But wait, there's more! As the hat continues to influence the sea's ecosystem, it would also become... CRUDE OIL! (D) Okay, not exactly, but hear me out! The hat's presence would stimulate the growth of microorganisms, which would break down the organic matter into a rich, oily substance.

And finally, as the sea continues to evolve and change, the hat would eventually become... THE TASMAN SEA! (E) Well, not literally, but think about it - the hat's journey from being a simple hat to becoming a thriving underwater world is a metaphor for the transformation that can occur when something new and unexpected is introduced to an ecosystem!

So, what do you think? Have we successfully transformed that yellow hat into all the answer choices?

A:
A A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "A thing to help": This could be referring to the fact that the answer is something that provides assistance or support in some way.
2. "A thing to use": This could be hinting that the answer is something that is used by humans, perhaps in a specific context or situation.
3. "When it is cold": This phrase is likely related to the answer's purpose or function, which might be more prominent or important during colder weather or situations.
4. "I am absorbent": This is an interesting characteristic! The answer is likely something that has the ability to absorb or soak up something, perhaps fluids or liquids.
5. "I help all": This phrase suggests that the answer is something that is widely beneficial or helpful to many people or entities.
6. "When things are running i am the one to call": This phrase is quite intriguing! It could be hinting that the answer is something that is called upon or summoned when things are moving or functioning smoothly, perhaps in a specific context like a machine or a system.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer choices.

I think the correct answer is (A) tissue!

Here's my reasoning:

* Tissues are a thing to help, as they can provide comfort and relief when we're feeling under the weather or need to clean up a spill.
* Tissues are a thing to use, as we often use them to wipe our noses, clean surfaces, or apply medication.
* When it's cold, tissues might be more important to have on hand, as our noses can get drier and more prone to irritation.
* Tissues are absorbent, as they can soak up liquids and help to clean and dry surfaces.
* Tissues help all, as they can be used by people of all ages and backgrounds to address a variety of needs.
* When things are running smoothly (like a machine

Q: The thunder comes before the lightning, and the lightning comes before the cloud, the rain dries all the land it touches, wrapping the earth in a blood red shroud what am i ?? Answer Choices: (A) volcano (B) trees (C) lightening (D) weather (E) disneyland
A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

1. "The thunder comes before the lightning": This suggests that the thunder is a precursor to the lightning, which is an unusual sequence. This could imply that the "lightning" isn't a literal lightning bolt, but rather something that precedes it.
2. "The lightning comes before the cloud": This statement further supports the idea that the "lightning" is not a natural phenomenon, as clouds usually precede thunderstorms. It seems like we're dealing with a metaphor or a figure of speech.
3. "The rain dries all the land it touches, wrapping the earth in a blood red shroud": This phrase is quite vivid and ominous! Rain is typically associated with wetting the land, not drying it. The image of a "blood red shroud" is also unsettling. This could be a poetic way of describing something that's both destructive and transformative.

Taking these clues into account, I'd like to propose an unconventional answer: a "Volcanic Eruption"!

Here's how the riddle could be interpreted:

* "The thunder comes before the lightning" could refer to the loud rumbling noise that precedes a volcanic eruption, often accompanied by a massive ash cloud that blocks out the sun.
* "The lightning comes before the cloud" might be a poetic way of describing the intense heat and light emitted during the eruption, which can create a bright, fiery glow.
* "The rain dries all the land it touches, wrapping the earth in a blood red shroud" could be a vivid description of the devastating effects of a volcanic eruption, which can bring forth a torrent of molten lava, ash, and pyroclastic flows that "dry" the land and leave a scarlet-red landscape in its wake.

What do you think? Is my creative interpretation on the mark, or am I just venturing into the realm of fantasy?

As a snowman, I'd imagine they'd need something to keep them... well, not melting away, of course!

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

1. "Light as a feather": This phrase is quite literal, isn't it? It's suggesting that the answer is incredibly light, almost weightless.
2. "Nothing in it": This line makes me wonder if the answer is empty or void of any substance. Hmm...
3. "Few can hold it": This part implies that the answer is ephemeral or fleeting, and not many people can grasp or hold onto it for more than a brief moment.
4. "For more than a minute": This last line reinforces the idea that the answer is short-lived or transitory.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... YOUR BREATH! 

Here's my reasoning:

* "Light as a feather": Air is essentially weightless, making it incredibly light.
* "Nothing in it": A breath contains no physical substance, just air molecules.
* "Few can hold it": While we can hold our breath for a short time, it's challenging to do so for more than a minute or two.
* "For more than a minute": As mentioned earlier, holding your breath for more than a minute is a feat few people can accomplish.

Q: With the rich I am blue, with the poor I am red, with the amphibian I am cold but with the dog I am hot instead, what am I? Answer Choices: (A) red cross (B) hat rack (C) red clover (D) blood (E) lizard
A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into it!

With the rich I am blue: This could be referring to the fact that the rich often wear blue, or that the rich are associated with a sense of luxury, and blue is a color often associated with luxury.

With the poor I am red: This could be because the poor are often associated with poverty, and red is a color often associated with passion, love, and even anger, which could be seen as a reflection of the struggles the poor face.

With the amphibian I am cold: Ah, this is where things get interesting! Amphibians, such as frogs and toads, spend part of their lives in cold water, so "cold" could be a reference to the temperature.

With the dog I am hot instead: And finally, with dogs, "hot" could be referring to the temperature as well, but also to the emotional connection humans have with dogs - dogs are often associated with warmth, love, and affection.

Now, let's see if we can tie these together... Could the answer be something that is perceived differently by different people or groups, depending on their perspective? Something that is associated with different emotions, temperatures, or values?

Hmmm... I think I have it!

I believe the answer is... (D) Blood!

With the rich, blood is often associated with wealth and status, hence "blue". With the poor, blood is often associated with struggle and hardship, hence "red". With amphibians, blood is often cold, as in the case of cold-blooded animals. And with dogs, blood is often warm and loving, as in the case of the strong bond between humans and dogs.

You bury me when I'm alive...

You are... a SEED!

When a seed is planted, it's "alive" in a sense, as it has the potential to grow. And when it's buried underground, it's receiving the necessary conditions to sprout and grow. And when it's "dead" (i.e., mature), you can dig it up to harvest the plant that grew from it!

A:
B A
What a delightful puzzle! Let's take a creative journey to solve it!

First, let's analyze the clues:

1. "For some, I am used to get around." - This suggests that the answer is related to transportation or movement.
2. "I never even touch the ground." - This implies that the answer doesn't physically interact with the ground.
3. "Sometimes I fall in a large open tank." - This could refer to an unexpected event or a sudden change of circumstances.
4. "And sometimes I float in the air and then raise." - This phrase hints at a transformation or an ascension.

Now, let's think outside the box and consider some unconventional options. Since the answer is used for transportation, but doesn't touch the ground, it might not be a typical mode of transportation like a bus or train.

Hmmm... What if we think of something that can move through the air, but isn't a living creature like a fly? That's when it hits me! What if the answer is a...

GAS BALLOON!

Gas balloons can be used to get around, and they don't touch the ground. They can fall in a large open tank (a hangar or a storage facility) when they're deflated or not in use. And, when they're filled with hot air, they can float in the air and then raise to ascend to great heights!

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is:

(B) GAS

We're looking for something that you can't get rid of by losing it. That means, if you "lose" it, you still won't be rid of it.

Q: I have no limbs and no body but one head.  Answer Choices: (A) headway (B) paws (C) morgue (D) nail (E) place
A:
D E
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I have no limbs" - This suggests that whatever we're thinking of doesn't have arms, legs, hands, or feet.
* "and no body" - This reinforces the idea that there's no physical torso or main structure.
* "but one head" - Ah-ha! This is the key. We have one head, which implies that we're thinking of a single, self-contained unit.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

* (A) headway: This phrase refers to progress or advancement, but it doesn't fit the description.
* (B) paws: Paws are attached to limbs, so this doesn't work.
* (C) morgue: A morgue is a place where bodies are stored, but it's not a single head.
* (D) nail: A nail is a small, individual component, but it's not a head.
* (E) place: This is the most intriguing option, as a "place" can be thought of as a location or a spot. But it's not a single head.

Ah, but what if we think outside the box (or in this case, outside the body)?

I propose that the correct answer is... (E) place! Think about it: a place can be a single, defined location, but it doesn't have a physical body or limbs. It's a spot, a point, a location – and it has a single "head" or center. Clever, right?

What a delightful puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

You stand in one place, yet you fill a whole room. That's quite an intriguing start! It's not something that can move or change location, so it's likely something that's stationary.

Next, you can be filled with molten rock. That's a fascinating twist! This suggests that you're not something that's typically associated with molten rock, like a lamp or a mirror. And, it's unlikely that you'd be a couch, as that would require some rather... unusual upholstery choices!

Now, coming in every hue is an exciting clue! This implies that you're not just a single, monochromatic entity. Instead, you're something that can take on a wide range of colors, like paint!

Taking all these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is... (E) paint!

Paint is often applied to a surface, which means it "stands in one place" (the wall, floor, or whatever it's being applied to). It can fill a whole room, covering large areas with a single application. And, of course, paint can come in a vast array of colors, from molten lava red to calming sky blue!

Q: A king without a crown Answer Choices: (A) court (B) lion (C) man (D) paint (E) spleen
A:
B A
What a intriguing question!

At first glance, I'd say that the correct answer is likely related to royalty, as the question mentions a "king". But, which one of the options sounds like a reasonable fit?

Hmmm... I think I'd start by imagining a king, and what's usually associated with a king... Ah-ha! The crown! It's a symbol of their power and authority. So, if a king "without a crown", what does that even mean?

Could it be... that the king is "without a crown" because they're not wearing one? In that case, I'd say the correct answer is (A) court. Perhaps the king is in their court, but without their usual crown. The court is a place where the king holds court, so it makes sense in this context!

But wait, there's more! What if we think about the word "without" in a more poetic sense? Could it mean that the king is without a sense of authority, without a sense of self, or without a sense of purpose? In that case, the correct answer might be (C) man. The king, as a person, is struggling to find their place or sense of identity without their usual symbols of power.

And then, there's the possibility that the question is playing with our expectations of what a king looks like. Maybe the king without a crown is a metaphor for someone who's not conforming to societal norms or expectations. In that case, the correct answer could be (B) lion, as lions are known for being bold and unafraid to challenge the status quo!

Of course, there's also the possibility that the question is a play on words, and the correct answer is actually (D) paint. Perhaps the king is an artist, and they're painting a new self-image, free from the constraints of their usual royal persona.

And, just for kicks, I'd like to propose an alternative answer, (E) spleen! Maybe the king without a crown is literally missing their crown-shaped spleen? Okay, maybe that's a bit of a stretch, but I had to go there!

B) Eraser: Ah, eraser! That's an interesting one. If I write "eraser" forward, it's still readable. If I write it backward, it's still readable... And if I write it upside down? Well, I think I'd still be able to read it left to right, wouldn't you?

C) Weekday: Oh, weekdays! That's a clever choice. If I write "weekday" forward, it's still readable. If I write it backward... Hmm, I'm not sure if it's still readable in this case. But, if I write it upside down? That's a bit too tricky for me to visualize!

D) Noon: Noon! That's a great option. If I write "noon" forward, it's still readable. If I write it backward... Well, that's a bit of a stretch, but I think I could still read it left to right. And if I write it upside down? Hmm... I think I'd still be able to read it!

E) Night: Ah, night! That's a lovely choice. If I write "night" forward, it's still readable. If I write it backward... Well, that's a bit of a stretch, but I think I could still read it left to right. And if I write it upside down? Hmm... I think I'd still be able to read it!

A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed take a step-by-step approach to unravel the mystery.

First, let's focus on the statement "I have a face, but I do not speak." This suggests that the answer is not a living being that can speak. It could be an inanimate object that has a "face" or a surface that resembles a face.

Next, let's consider the phrase "I have hands, but never reach." This is an intriguing contradiction. If the answer has hands, it's likely an inanimate object, and if it never reaches, it might imply that the hands are not functional.

Now, let's examine each answer choice:

A) Human face: While humans have faces, they do speak. This answer doesn't fit the description.

B) Hit: A hit is not an object that has a face or hands.

C) Handspring: A handspring is a physical activity, not an object.

D) Grandfather clock: Ah-ha! A grandfather clock has a face (the clock face) and hands (hour and minute hands), but it doesn't speak and the hands are not capable of reaching.

E) Waving: Waving is an action, not an object.

Considering the clues and answer choices, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the correct answer is indeed (D) Grandfather clock. The clock's face is a surface that resembles a face, and its hands (hour and minute hands) are not capable of reaching.

Q: They are many and one, they wave and they drum, used to cover a state, they go with you everywhere Answer Choices: (A) ears (B) country (C) hands (D) marching band (E) drum set
A:
C B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"They are many and one" - This phrase suggests a collective entity, something that can be considered a single unit despite being composed of multiple parts.

"They wave and they drum" - This is a interesting combination! "Wave" makes me think of a physical movement, like arms or hands moving up and down. "Drum" makes me think of a rhythmic sound, like music.

"Used to cover a state" - Ah, a hint about geography! This makes me think of a map, and how a map can cover a state or a region.

"They go with you everywhere" - This final phrase suggests a constant companion, something that accompanies you throughout your journey.

With these clues in mind, let's see... Could it be that the answer is related to... MAPS!

Think about it: maps are often composed of multiple parts (states, regions, cities), yet they're considered a single entity. Maps wave and drum in the sense that they can be unfolded, and the creases can be thought of as drumming rhythms on the paper. Maps used to cover states (on a physical level), and they can accompany you everywhere you go (digitally or in print form).

Am I correct?

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I move silently" - Ah, something that doesn't make a sound!

"Without wings" - Hmm, no flying creatures here!

"Between silvery, silken strings" - Ooh, I love the sensory details! "Silvery" and "silken" suggest something smooth and shiny. It's like we're talking about threads or fibers!

"And there stretched in the grass" - Ah, something that's laid out, possibly intentionally!

"You'll see my web as you pass" - Aha! So, it's something that creates a web-like structure!

Now, let's think about the answer choices...

(C) Spider is a great guess, but it doesn't quite fit the "move silently" part. Spiders can make noise while moving.

(D) Web page is a clever guess, but it's not a physical entity that moves or creates a web.

(E) Net is a good guess, but it doesn't quite fit the "silvery, silken strings" part.

(A) Hold... Hmm, how can we apply this answer to the riddle? Ah-ha! What if we think of a guitar string? When you move your fingers along the strings, you can create a web-like pattern on the fretboard!

A:
E E
What a delightful puzzle! Let's dive into the waters of creativity and find the solution!

As we ponder the situation, we can break it down into smaller pieces. We know:

1. The boat sank, which means all four men were in the water.
2. Three of the men's hair was wet, which is expected, as they were in the water.
3. One of the men's hair is dry, which is the puzzling part.

Here's where creativity comes in!

I propose that the answer is (E) Man was bald. 

Think about it: if one of the men was bald, his hair wouldn't get wet, even if he was in the water! The fact that his hair is dry doesn't mean he wasn't in the water; it simply means he doesn't have any hair to get wet.

Voilà! The solution is as simple as a splash of creativity!

Answer Choices: (A) Witches house (B) president (C) bathroom (D) christmas tree (E) doors
A:
B D
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

We know the following:

1. Robby lives in the red house (but there is no red house mentioned, so this is a red herring... or should I say, red mist?)
2. Beth lives in the green house.
3. Martha lives in the yellow house.
4. Caleb lives in the blue house.
5. Katie lives in the lavender house.

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) Witches house - seems unlikely, but who knows? Maybe there's a witchy abode?
(B) President - unlikely, as the problem statement doesn't mention a presidential residence
(C) Bathroom - Hmm... could be a quirky, cozy bathroom, but it's not a conventional living space
(D) Christmas tree - Ah, now this is an interesting idea! Could the white house be a festive Christmas tree?
(E) Doors - This is a clever answer, but I think we can rule it out, as it's a bit too literal

Considering the given information and the options, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the correct answer is... (D) Christmas tree!

Imagine a whimsical, magical neighborhood where each house represents a different color, and the white house is a beautiful, sparkling Christmas tree, surrounded by its festive colors. It's a charming, enchanting idea that fits the playful tone of the puzzle.

A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down and get creative!

1. "I am a prisoner trapped and I can't escape" - This suggests that you're not a living being, but rather an inanimate object or a concept that's confined or restricted.
2. "I have glimpses of daylight but only when my master is being rude" - Ah, now this is interesting! The connection between the master's rudeness and the glimpses of daylight makes me think that the "master" might be someone who's responsible for allowing or denying you access to light. Perhaps the "rudeness" is a clue about the master's behavior or attitude?
3. "I am quite long as well as being slimy" - Ooh, this gives me some ideas! The combination of being long and slimy makes me think of something that's typically found in the kitchen or related to food.
4. "My main objective in life is to deal with food" - Ah, now we're getting to the crux of the matter! With the connection to food and the previous hints, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you're a...

SALAD DRESSING!

Here's my reasoning:

* You're a prisoner trapped, which could refer to being confined to a bottle or container.
* You have glimpses of daylight when your master is being rude, which might imply that the master is a chef or someone who's preparing food, and the "rudeness" is related to the way they handle or talk about you (i.e., not being gentle or kind).
* You're long and slimy, which fits with the texture and consistency of many salad dressings.
* Your main objective is to deal with food, which is exactly what salad dressing does!

What a delightful riddle! Let's dive in and get creative!

First, I notice that the description is quite vivid, painting a picture of something slippery, wet, and greasy. That's a great starting point!

Next, I'll consider the phrase "when it's in its easy." Hmm... What could be "in its easy" state? Perhaps something that's relaxed, calm, or at peace? That's a good clue!

Now, let's think about the phrase "when it's out it jumps about." This suggests that whatever it is, it has a sudden burst of energy or movement when it's no longer in its relaxed state. Fascinating!

Combining these ideas, I'm going to take a leap (pun intended!) and propose a creative answer:

What if the correct answer is an EEL? 

Here's how it fits:

* "Slippery, wet, and greasy" describes an eel's slimy, wet skin and its tendency to slide through the water.
* "When it's in its easy" could refer to an eel's typical calm, sluggish state when it's swimming or resting.
* "When it's out it jumps about" might describe the sudden burst of speed and agility an eel displays when it's startled, escaping predators, or even making a dramatic escape through water!

What do you think? Am I swimming in the right direction or should I dive back in and rethink?

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's start by digging deep (pun intended, since you're a seed underground!) and analyzing each line.

"Many like to spread me around" - This line suggests that the seed is something that's easily dispersed or shared, which might be related to its growth or reproduction.

"But my family it's said is quite insane" - This line hints at a peculiar or unusual nature, which could be a characteristic of the seed or its family.

"And if you've a low I. Q.  you've this kind of brain" - This line is likely a playful reference to the idea that the seed might be related to something that's often associated with intelligence or cognitive abilities. The "I. Q." part is a clever play on words, referencing both the seed's family and intelligence quotient!

"Eat me raw and I'll make you sick" - This line suggests that the seed might be toxic or unpalatable if consumed raw, which could be a warning to avoid eating it in that form.

"Eat too much and your tongue will stick" - This line is a clever clue, as it implies that the seed or its derivative might cause a physical reaction if consumed in excess. The tongue sticking could be a metaphor for a physical or sensory experience.

Considering all these lines, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (B) Fruit!

Fruits are often spread around by animals or natural processes, and some fruits come from "insane" or unusual plants (e.g., durian or jackfruit). If you eat a fruit raw, it might not be palatable or even make you sick. And if you eat too much of a certain fruit, you might experience a physical reaction like a sticky tongue (e.g., due to excessive sugar or fiber intake)!

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into it step by step, shall we?

Firstly, you mentioned that you are square or rectangle, which suggests that the object in question has a geometric shape.

Next, you see this object in various locations such as the bathroom, school, and stores. This could imply that the object is something that is commonly found in public or shared spaces.

Now, you said that when you're dirty, this object cleans you, and when you're broke, it fixes you. This sounds like a rather unusual relationship, but it could be hinting at the object's function or purpose.

With all these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer might be (D) mirror!

Here's my reasoning:

* Mirrors are typically rectangular or square in shape, which fits the geometric clue.
* You can find mirrors in bathrooms, schools, and stores, which matches the locations mentioned.
* When you're "dirty" (i.e., dirty or smudged), you clean a mirror to remove streaks and smudges. And when you're "broke" (i.e., broken or cracked), you might fix a mirror by replacing it or repairing it.

A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "So cold, damp and dark" - This suggests an environment that's unpleasant and uncomfortable.
* "This place to stay" - This implies a location where people might normally reside.
* "You would refrain" - This means that most people would not choose to stay here.
* "Yet those who occupy this place do never complain" - This is the paradoxical part! Despite the unpleasant conditions, those who live here don't seem to mind.

Hmm... Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Grave: While graves can be dark and damp, it's unlikely that people would "occupy" a grave. Plus, graves are usually not considered "places to stay".

(B) Living room: A living room is often a cozy and comfortable space. It doesn't quite fit the description of being "cold, damp, and dark".

(C) Pleasant: This option seems to be the opposite of what the question is describing.

(D) Wound: A wound can be a painful and uncomfortable place, but it's not a location where people would normally reside.

(E) Neck: Hmm... A neck isn't typically a place where people would stay either.

So, where does this leave us?

I think the answer is... (A) Grave! But not because people occupy the grave itself. Instead, I think the question is referring to people who are buried in graves. Despite being in a grave, which is "cold, damp, and dark", the deceased individuals don't complain because they're, well... dead!

* "Hello" is a greeting, which makes me think of a friendly, welcoming vibe.

My answer is: (A) aloha!

Aloha is a Hawaiian greeting that encompasses not only a "hello" but also a sense of love, peace, and warmth. It's a fitting answer, as it's a word that embodies the spirit of the island, the warmth of the tropical sun, and the welcoming nature of the locals.

You can show any person or anything, but they won't move because they're asleep. That's a great clue!

The next part is intriguing: you surround these people or things with a border that is sure to please. A border can be physical or metaphorical. Hmm...

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Lion: Not a great fit, as lions aren't typically associated with borders or pleasing anyone while they're sleeping.

B. Picture: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A picture can surround people or things, and it's often a pleasing and aesthetically pleasing way to display them. But, pictures don't exactly "please" anyone while they're asleep... unless...

C. Fall asleep: This choice doesn't seem to fit, as falling asleep isn't something you can show or surround with a border.

D. Patient: This choice is an interesting one! A patient can be surrounded by a hospital bed, medical equipment, or a waiting area, which could be a pleasing environment. But, patients aren't exactly known for being pleased while they're asleep.

E. Happy: This choice doesn't quite fit, as happiness isn't necessarily related to a border or people/ things being asleep.

Hmmm... I think I've got it! The correct answer is... (drumroll, please)... B. Picture!

When someone is asleep, you can surround them with a picture frame, which is a pleasing and aesthetically pleasing way to display their likeness. Voilà!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I build bridges of silver and crowns of gold."

Hmm... This phrase is quite vivid and evocative. "Bridges of silver" and "crowns of gold" sound like things that are valuable, precious, and maybe even a bit luxurious.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Dentist: Hmm... While dentists do work with silver and gold fillings, I don't think they "build bridges" or "create crowns" in the classical sense. (Unless... unless they're working on some kind of avant-garde art project?)

B. Canal: This option seems promising! Canals are indeed man-made waterways, and "bridges of silver" could refer to the canal's structure, with "silver" representing a shiny, reflective surface. And "crowns of gold" could symbolize the canal's importance and value. But... is this the most creative interpretation?

C. Cities: This option has potential! Cities are often built with grand, impressive structures, and "bridges of silver" could refer to the city's infrastructure. "Crowns of gold" might symbolize the city's prestige and glory. However, cities don't typically "build" crowns, so this option feels a bit of a stretch.

D. Land: This option seems a bit... vague. While land can be valuable and precious, it's hard to imagine it "building" bridges or crowns.

E. Treasure chest: Ah, now this option has some real potential! Treasure chests are often associated with precious metals and jewels, and "bridges of silver" could represent the connections between treasures within the chest. And "crowns of gold" might symbolize the treasures' value and worth. But... is this the most poetic or creative interpretation?

And then... it hits me!

What if the answer is not a physical entity at all, but rather an abstract concept? What if the answer is... A POEM!

In this interpretation, the "bridges of silver" represent the poet

3. We're left with options that are not living things, so let's eliminate the search (C) as it doesn't fit the description.
4. A glove (D) has fingers, but it's not typically described as having a thumb, and it's not usually associated with only four fingers.
5. An index finger (A) has one thumb, but it's a part of a human hand, which we already eliminated.
6. A wedding band (B) doesn't have fingers or a thumb, so it's not a good fit.
7. A ladyfinger (E) is a type of baked good, but it doesn't have fingers or a thumb either.

Hmmm... What could it be?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I think the correct answer is... a book!

A book has four fingers (or pages) and one thumb (the binding that connects the pages). It's not a living thing, an animal, or a part of an animal, and it fits the description. What do you think?

Q: there is a room,when anyone enter's,the person becomes crazy. which room am i? Answer Choices: (A) candy (B) office building (C) bed (D) bathroom (E) poolroom
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* The room is special in a way that makes anyone who enters it become crazy.
* This implies that the room has some kind of unusual or unpredictable effect on people.
* Out of the options, the ones that stand out to me as having some kind of unusual effect are:
	+ (A) Candy: Who knows what kind of crazy-making sweets could be inside?!
	+ (E) Poolroom: Imagine the stress and frustration of trying to make a tricky shot, and then suddenly, BAM! You're crazy!

But, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is actually... (C) Bed!

Think about it: have you ever had a crazy dream or woken up feeling like you'd lost your mind after a particularly weird or intense sleep? Maybe the room is actually a bed, and the "crazy-making" effect is just the power of our own subconscious minds!

A:

I love a good puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said!

A key is typically used to unlock a door, so if we're looking for a type of key that doesn't open a door, we need to think about what kind of key doesn't have the primary function of unlocking doors.

Hmmm... 

Cut key is a type of key used for cutting or shaping metal, so it's not a key that opens doors.

History key could be a metaphorical key, unlocking knowledge or understanding, but it's not a physical key that opens doors.

Control panel key is more like a button or a switch that controls a system, but it's not a key that opens doors either.

Trailer key is used to unlock a trailer, but it's not a key that opens a door.

And then there's... 

Donkey! Ah-ha! A donkey is often referred to as an ass, and an "ass" is a type of key on a musical keyboard! It's a key that doesn't open a door, but rather makes beautiful music!

So, I'm going to take a chance and say the correct answer is (E) donkey! Am I right?

Q: I am always on top of you, unless you are without me.  If you cut me I don't cry, but you do if I poke you in the eye.  You can change my color on your own will, just don't worry about jealous "Bald Bill".  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) brush cut (B) bed (C) your mother (D) your hair (E) muscle
A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and see where it takes us.

First, "I am always on top of you, unless you are without me." This suggests that the answer is something that is typically in contact with or near the subject, but not necessarily always physically attached.

Next, "If you cut me I don't cry, but you do if I poke you in the eye." This implies that the answer is something that can be harmed or injured in some way, but doesn't have the capacity to feel pain or emotions itself. Instead, it's the subject who would experience pain or discomfort if certain actions are taken.

The third clue, "You can change my color on your own will, just don't worry about jealous 'Bald Bill'." This is where things get really interesting! The mention of "Bald Bill" and the ability to change color suggests that the answer is something that is often associated with human appearance or identity.

Now, let's see if we can tie these clues together. Based on the fact that the answer is often near the subject, can be harmed, and can change color, I'm going to take a guess that the correct answer is... (D) your hair!

Here's how the clues fit:

* "I am always on top of you, unless you are without me": Hair is often on top of one's head, but someone can be bald or have little to no hair.
* "If you cut me I don't cry, but you do if I poke you in the eye": Cutting one's hair doesn't cause the hair itself to cry, but the person getting their hair cut might feel discomfort or pain if the stylist accidentally pokes their eye.
* "You can change my color on your own will, just don't worry about jealous 'Bald Bill'": People can change their hair color with

What a clever question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

The man rode into a town on a specific day of the week, which is... Friday!

He stayed for three nights, which means he spent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday in the town.

And then, he rode back out of the town on... Friday again!

Hmm... How is this possible?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The answer is... (C) isle of man!

You see, the Isle of Man is located in the Irish Sea, and it's an island! So, the man could have ridden into the town on the island of Man on Friday, stayed for three nights, and then ridden back out of the town on the same day, Friday, since he was on an island where the days only have 24 hours, not the 72 hours we experience on the mainland!

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the mystery together!

Who makes it, has no need of it.

Hmm... Who makes it, but doesn't need it? That's a tough one! But wait a minute... Could it be that the maker is an artist or a craftsman who creates something, but doesn't need it themselves because they're making it for someone else? Or maybe it's someone who makes something as a gift or a service, but they don't require it for themselves?

Who buys it, has no use for it.

Okay, so we have our first clue, and now we have to think about who buys it, but has no use for it. Ah-ha! I think I've got it! When someone buys something, they might do it for sentimental reasons, out of obligation, or as an investment, but they might not actually need it or use it themselves! For example, buying a gift for someone else, or investing in a property that won't be lived in personally.

Who uses it, has no knowledge of it.

Now we have our third clue! Who uses it, but has no knowledge of it? Hmm... That's a tricky one! But I think I've got it! When someone uses something, they might not always understand its full purpose or intricacies. For instance, a person might use a smartphone without knowing how to program it or understand its internal workings. Or maybe someone uses a tool or equipment without knowing its full capabilities!

Now that we've broken down each clue, let's see if we can find the answer that fits all three scenarios!

Which one do you think fits the bill?

A:
C C
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said!

The man says, "Brothers and Sisters I have none," which means he has no siblings.

The sentence that follows, "but that man's father is my father's son," is a bit trickier. Let's analyze it:

* "that man's father" is the father of the person he's pointing at.
* "is my father's son" means that this person's father is also the man's father.

Now, let's combine these two statements:

* The person he's pointing at has no siblings (since the man says he has no siblings).
* This person's father is also the man's father.

The only way this can be true is if the person he's pointing at is... his own son!

So, the correct answer is (C) his son!

Let's break it down:

* Bill's wife wants her anniversary present to be on the driveway tomorrow.
* It needs to be able to go from 0-200 in 2 seconds.

Hmm... a car or a vehicle that can accelerate that quickly would be a great fit, but what about a "package"?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The answer is... (E) Scale!

Here's why: a scale is a device that measures weight or speed. Imagine a tiny, high-tech scale that can not only measure weight but also accelerate to incredible speeds!

The "package" shows up on the driveway, and when his wife opens it, she finds this futuristic scale. The "0-200 in 2 seconds" requirement is met, as the scale can instantly measure her weight, and then, with a burst of speed, it zooms back down to zero, ready for the next measurement!

A:

What a delightful old riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step, like a master puzzle solver

1. "Holding two swords and eight spears" - This suggests someone or something that can wield multiple sharp objects. It's not a living creature, as it's not mentioned as such.
2. "Dressed in a cow-leather tunic" - Ah, now we have a material clue! Cow-leather is a common material for armor, so this person might be wearing armor.
3. "I peek through a hole in the door" - This is a curious phrase. Why would someone peek through a hole in the door? It implies that the "I" is looking out from the other side of the door.

Now, let's combine these clues...

Hmm... Who could be holding multiple sharp objects, wearing armor, and peeking through a hole in a door?

Could it be... (drumroll please)... a BUTCHER!

Imagine a butcher, dressed in leather armor (cow-leather tunic), holding two swords and eight spears (meat cleavers and skewers). They might be peeking through a hole in the door to check if the meat is cooked or to inspect the next cut of meat.

So, I think the correct answer is (A) JAVELIN, but only because it's not the most creative answer. The real answer is the BUTCHER, of course!

A:
A D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, "Hands she has but does not hold" - This suggests that the entity has appendages that resemble human hands, but they're not capable of grasping or holding anything. Hmm...

Next, "teeth she has but does not bite" - This implies that the entity has a set of teeth, but they're not used for eating or biting. This is an interesting combination...

Then, "feet she has but they are cold" - This statement makes me think that the entity's feet are not typically warm or used for movement, but rather... frozen?

Lastly, "eyes she has but without sight" - This could mean that the entity has eyes, but they're not functioning as they would in a human. Perhaps they're not capable of seeing or perceiving their surroundings?

Now, let's combine these clues and see if we can pinpoint the answer!

Considering all these peculiarities, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (D) shoe!

A shoe has a shape resembling hands, with its laces or straps resembling fingers. It has a "tooth-like" structure in the sole, but it doesn't bite. The sole can be cold, especially if it's made of a cold material. And, of course, shoes have eyes (eyelets) but they don't have the ability to see. What do you think?

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I shines through the night even though no power is around": This suggests that the answer is not an artificial light source that requires electricity.
* "It discovers many invisible things": This implies that the answer is not just a physical object, but something that can perceive or sense things that are not visible to the human eye.
* "It's yellow or white": This gives us a hint about the answer's color.
* "It's silent doesn't sing, No sound": This rules out any living creature that makes noise.
* "It can come and go, And sometimes It dies": This suggests that the answer is not a permanent entity, but something that can change or disappear.
* "It's not the sun": This is a given, as the sun is not invisible and makes a lot of noise!

With these clues in mind, let's think creatively...

Hmm... Could it be... (drumroll please)... the Moon?

* It shines through the night, even without power, because it reflects the sun's light.
* It discovers many invisible things, like the tides, ocean currents, and even the Earth's magnetic field.
* It can appear yellow or white, depending on the amount of sunlight it reflects.
* It's silent and doesn't make a sound, unlike many other celestial bodies.
* It can appear to come and go, as it orbits the Earth, and sometimes it experiences lunar eclipses, which could be seen as "dying".
* And finally, it's not the sun!

Q: I have a mouth but don't have a hand I have a body but don't have feet. Try me Answer Choices: (A) mountain (B) humans (C) its (D) taco (E) bank
A:
A A
What a deliciously puzzling question!

Let's break it down, step by step, just like you said!

First, "I have a mouth but don't have a hand." Hmm... A mouth is typically associated with something that can speak or make sounds, while a hand is for grasping or manipulating things. This makes me think of something that can communicate in some way, but not necessarily physically interact with its surroundings.

Next, "I have a body but don't have feet." This adds another layer of intrigue! A body implies a physical form, while feet are typically associated with movement or locomotion. This could suggest something that has a physical presence, but doesn't have the ability to move around or change its position easily.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose... (drumroll please)... option A: mountain!

Here's my reasoning: A mountain has a "mouth" in the sense that it has a peak or summit, and it can be thought of as having a "body" in the sense that it's a large, solid mass of earth and rock. However, it doesn't have hands, and while it has a base, it doesn't have feet in the classical sense. Mountains can also be thought of as having a "presence" or a "body" that dominates the surrounding landscape, even though they're stationary.

The poem describes a serene and soothing scene: a gentle song, a willow tree, and a sense of relief from pain and sorrow. The speaker wishes to fly away, but tarries, and in their suffering, the willow is likened to a cool clear spring.

This tells me that the willow tree is not just a mere setting, but rather a source of comfort and solace. The word "spring" also suggests something refreshing and rejuvenating.

None of the options seem to fit the bill, as they are all types of trees, but not exactly what I would expect to be the source of comfort in this scenario.

Wait a minute... what if I think outside the box?

What if the answer is not a type of tree at all, but rather a metaphorical representation of something that brings relief and comfort?

Hmmm... Ah-ha! I've got it!

The answer is... (E) Bird!

Yes! The bird sang softly unto the speaker, easing their pain and sorrow with its song. The willow tree is merely the setting where this magical encounter took place. The bird's song is what brought solace and comfort to the speaker, making them wish to fly away (perhaps to be free from their pain and sorrow).

Am I correct?

Hmmm... Let's break it down:

* It has branches... Ah, maybe not physical branches like a tree, but perhaps metaphorical or figurative branches?
* It has leaves... Could these leaves be symbolic or represent something?
* But it has no bark... That's a great clue! If it's not a physical tree, what could be hiding under the surface?

Aha! I think I've got it!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you said!

**Step 1:** "I cannot be felt, seen or touched;"

Hmm... this makes me think of something that's intangible, yet has a presence.

**Step 2:** "Yet I can be found in everybody;"

Ah-ha! This implies that this thing is a universal concept, a common thread that runs through all of humanity.

**Step 3:** "My existence is always in debate;"

Ooh, interesting! This suggests that the existence of this thing is often questioned, debated, or even disputed.

**Step 4:** "Yet I have my own style of music."

Whoa! This adds a creative twist! It implies that this thing has a unique expression or aesthetic that's distinct from others.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer:

**Answer:** (A) antiphony

An antiphony is a musical response or counterpoint, often used in sacred music. It's an intangible concept, yet it can be found in every culture and music tradition. The existence of antiphony is often debated, and it has its own unique style and aesthetic.

Q: It is said among my people that some things are improved by death.   Tell me, what stinks while living, but in death, smells good? Answer Choices: (A) penultimate (B) pig (C) corpse (D) alive (E) rug
A:
B A
What an intriguing question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

(A) Penultimate is a word that doesn't quite fit the bill. It's a literary term that refers to the second-to-last thing, not something that can be improved by death.

(B) Pig... hmm, that's an interesting choice. While pigs can certainly have their own unique aroma while alive, it's not exactly something that's improved by death. In fact, decomposition can make their scent even more, shall we say, pungent.

(C) Corpse... now this is where things get interesting! It's common knowledge that death can have a profound impact on the way our bodies smell. In the case of a deceased pig, for instance, the decomposition process can break down the proteins and fats, releasing a more... earthy aroma. Some might even find it, dare I say, pleasant?

(D) Alive... this one's a bit of a red herring. While the concept of "alive" isn't something that can be improved by death, it's not the correct answer either.

(E) Rug... and finally, we have our rug! While a rug might not have a strong scent while it's in use, it's not uncommon for rugs to develop a musty smell over time due to dust, dirt, or moisture accumulation. However, I'm not convinced that death would improve the smell of a rug. In fact, a deceased rug might be a bit... grim.

So, taking a step back, I think our answer is... (C) Corpse!

A:
C B
What a delightful puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, let's analyze the clues:

1. "A harvest sown and reaped on the same day" - This suggests something that can be produced quickly, perhaps in a short span of time.
2. "In an unplowed field" - This implies that the field is not cultivated or prepared for planting, which makes it interesting.
3. "Which increases without growing" - This is a paradoxical statement, as we typically associate growth with increase. Perhaps the answer is an intangible or abstract concept?
4. "Remains whole though it is eaten" - This line makes me think of something that can be consumed or "eaten away" without losing its essence.
5. "Within and without, / Is useless and yet" - This phrase suggests a dual nature, where the answer is both present and absent at the same time, and its value is subjective.
6. "The staple of nations" - This final clue implies that the answer is essential to many societies or nations.

Now, let's try to combine these clues and find a connection. Ah-ha! What if the answer is... (drumroll please)... money!

Here's how the clues fit:

* "A harvest sown and reaped on the same day" - Money can be earned quickly, often in a single day, through various means like investments or financial transactions.
* "In an unplowed field" - Money can be earned without cultivating a physical field, as it's an intangible concept.
* "Which increases without growing" - Money can grow through interest, investments, or other financial means, even if its physical form doesn't change.
* "Remains whole though it is eaten" - Money can be spent or "eaten away" without losing its value or essence.
* "Within and without, / Is useless and yet" - Money has both subjective and objective value, as

Q: I am the black child of a white father, a wingless bird, flying even to the clouds of heaven.

Answer Choices: (A) sorrow (B) rail (C) death and decay (D) struggle (E) smoke
A:
E B
What a fascinating and poetic riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to unravel its secrets.

Firstly, we have "I am the black child of a white father." This immediately catches my attention, as it hints at a sense of duality and contrast. Black and white are often symbolic of opposing forces, like light and darkness, good and evil.

Next, we have "a wingless bird, flying even to the clouds of heaven." Ah, but what's this? A bird without wings? That's an oxymoron! Birds are defined by their wings, so this could be a metaphor for something that transcends the conventional boundaries. Flying to the clouds of heaven suggests a connection to the divine, the infinite, or the sublime.

Now, "I give birth to tears of mourning in pupils that meet me, even though there is no cause for grief." This line is quite poignant. Tears of mourning often indicate a loss or a sense of sadness. However, the phrase "even though there is no cause for grief" suggests that these tears are unexplained or unjustified. This could be a commentary on the human experience, where we often react with sadness or fear to things that are not necessarily cause for sorrow.

Finally, "and at once on my birth I am dissolved into air." This phrase is quite enigmatic. Being dissolved into air could mean that whatever this entity is, it's ephemeral, intangible, or fleeting. It could also suggest a loss of form or identity, as if the entity is being dispersed or scattered.

Taking all these clues into account, I'd propose that the answer might be (C) death and decay. Here's why:

* As the "black child of a white father," death and decay could be seen as the darker, mysterious, and often feared aspects of life, juxtaposed with the light and purity of life itself

Let's break it down:

* "What does not get to choose..." - This implies that whatever it is, it doesn't have control over its own fate.
* "...if it goes or in" - This is the key phrase! It's a play on words, and I think it's related to something that can be either "in" or "out" of something else.

With that in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is (E) prisoner.

Think about it: a prisoner doesn't get to choose if they go or stay in prison! They're stuck in there until they're released. Am I right?

Let's break it down:

* "People always ask for me" - This implies that the subject is something that people are seeking or wanting.
* "even though they don't like to face me" - This is the interesting part! It suggests that people are hesitant or reluctant to confront the subject, despite wanting it.

Hmmm... Given these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the answer is... (C) truth!

Think about it: people often seek the truth, but it can be uncomfortable or difficult to confront. It might be a painful revelation, a harsh reality, or a difficult conversation to have. Yet, people still seek it out because they know it's essential for growth, understanding, and progress.

Q: A golden treasure that never stays;  The coin whose face gives wealth to all.   Strands, nuggets, and dust of gold  are all bought with its shining grace. . .   And all are more precious than any gleaming metal.    What am I? Answer Choices: (A) face of god (B) helium (C) sun (D) fish tank (E) nuggets
A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the world of creativity and unravel the mystery together!

From the initial lines, we know that the treasure is golden, but it never stays, which hints that it's something intangible. The phrase "The coin whose face gives wealth to all" is intriguing, as it suggests that the face of the coin itself is what brings prosperity.

The next lines mention strands, nuggets, and dust of gold being bought with its shining grace. This could imply that the treasure is something that facilitates the acquisition of gold or gold-related items. However, the final line states that all these are more precious than any gleaming metal, which suggests that the treasure itself is not made of gold.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Face of God: This doesn't quite fit, as it's a spiritual concept rather than a tangible treasure.

(B) Helium: While helium is a gas, it doesn't quite match the description of a golden treasure that gives wealth to all.

(C) Sun: The sun is a powerful force, but it's not a treasure that gives wealth to all, and it's not something that can be bought or acquired.

(D) Fish Tank: This is an interesting option, but a fish tank doesn't quite fit the description of a golden treasure that gives wealth to all.

(E) Nuggets: This option seems promising, but the description suggests that the treasure is not made of gold itself, but rather facilitates the acquisition of gold.

Now, let's think outside the box! What if the treasure is not a physical object, but rather an intangible concept that gives wealth to all? What if the treasure is... (drumroll please)... CREDIT?

Credit is a form of golden treasure that never stays, as it's a digital representation that can be spent and replenished. The face of credit gives wealth to all, as it

Q: One Day three blonds were walking down the beach.  They came aross a magic lamp.  When they rubed it a genie came out.  Since there was three of them, the genie said they could each have one wish.  The first dumb blond wished to be 10% smarter, so the genie turned into a bruette. The second blond wished to be 20% smarter, so the genie turned her into a red head.  The third blond thought she was smart enough, so she wished to be 30% dumber.  What did the genie turn her into? Answer Choices: (A) man (B) niagra falls (C) job (D) ram (E) modern
A:
A A
What a delightful and humorous puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. The first blond wishes to be 10% smarter, so the genie makes her a brunette. (This implies that the genie can change their physical appearance based on their wish.)
2. The second blond wishes to be 20% smarter, and the genie turns her into a redhead. (Following the same pattern as step 1.)
3. The third blond thinks she's smart enough and wishes to be 30% dumber. Now, here's the clever part:

Since the genie can change physical appearance, it's likely that the third blond's wish would result in her changing into something that is, in fact, 30% less intelligent... than a human.

Hmmm... What's something that's not a human and is inherently less intelligent? Ah-ha!

I think the correct answer is (B) Niagara Falls! The third blond would be transformed into a waterfall, which is certainly less intelligent than a human. The genie would be turning her into a natural wonder, making her 30% dumber in the process.

Let's break it down:

* We're looking for a fish that can be seen better at night.
* Fish markets, boats, and tuna are not related to seeing fish at night, so they're out of the question.
* The "end of line" is a phrase that could refer to the end of a fishing line, but it's not a type of fish, so it's not the answer.
* Starfish are marine animals, but they're not fish, so we can't choose that one either.

Let's indeed think step by step.

The question asks what surrounds the world, yet dwells within a thimble. This implies that whatever the answer is, it must have a broader scope that encompasses the world, yet also has a smaller, more intimate presence within the confines of a thimble.

Hmm... What could that be?

I'm going to take a wild stab here...

Could it be that the answer is actually the "air"?

The world is surrounded by air, making it a fitting choice for the broader scope. And, if we think about it, air molecules are present in even the smallest of spaces, including the thimble! They might not be as prominent or visible, but they're still there, dwelling within the thimble.

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down together:

1. "I am rounded but wide": This suggests that the answer is not a pointy or angular shape. It's more likely to be a rounded or curvy object.
2. "Furry and yet shy": Ah, intriguing! This makes me think of something that has a soft, furry exterior, but perhaps it's not always outgoing or attention-seeking. Maybe it's a bit introverted?
3. "You favour my insides to the outi": This line is quite clever! It implies that the value or importance of the object lies within, rather than on its outer appearance.
4. "I am bountiful without any doubt": This final phrase hints at abundance or generosity, suggesting that the answer is something that provides a lot or is overflowing with something valuable.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that's not on the original list:

Could the answer be a MUSHROOM?

Here's how it fits the description:
* Rounded but wide: Mushrooms have a rounded cap and a wide stem.
* Furry and yet shy: Some mushrooms have a furry or velvety texture, and they might be shy or hiding in the underbrush.
* You favour my insides to the outi: The edible part of a mushroom is often considered more valuable than its outer cap.
* I am bountiful without any doubt: Mushrooms can be incredibly abundant in certain environments, and they provide a valuable food source for many creatures.

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested!

If I take away the whole of you, I get bigger... That's a clever clue!

Here's what I'm thinking:

* If I take away the whole of you, that means I'm removing the entire object.
* And if I get bigger after removing the whole of you, that implies that the object is somehow related to size or magnitude.

Now, let's examine each answer choice:

* (A) spare: Not sure how removing the whole of a spare would make it bigger...
* (B) cake: Hmmm... if I take away the whole cake, I'd be left with nothing, not bigger.
* (C) donut: Ah-ha! If I take away the whole donut (i.e., eat it), I'd be left with an empty hand, which could be considered bigger in the sense that I've consumed the donut!
* (D) hit: Not a physical object, so let's ignore this option.
* (E) one: This one's a bit tricky... if I take away the whole of "one," I'm left with zero, which is smaller, not bigger.

Let's start by breaking down the clues:

* "I am pink" - This suggests a color association.
* "I have a curly" - This could refer to a physical characteristic, like a hairstyle or a feature.
* "I am fat" - This implies a size or shape.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, let's consider each option:

(A) Dianthus - While dianthus flowers can have pink varieties, they aren't typically curly or fat.

(B) Pig - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Pigs can be pink, and they often have curly tails. And, let's be honest, some pigs can be a bit... rounded. This option is looking promising!

(C) Dry measure - Not sure how a dry measure would be pink, curly, or fat. This option seems unlikely.

(D) Sheep - Sheep can be pinkish in color, but they don't usually have curly features or be particularly plump.

(E) Frankenstein - While Frankenstein's monster can be depicted in various ways, it's unlikely to be pink, curly, and fat.

What a fascinating riddle! Let's unravel the mystery together, step by step!

Firstly, you mentioned that you can be winding and straight, which suggests that you're not a living thing, as living things can't be both winding and straight. This rules out options like a boat or an unravel.

Next, you said you can be smooth and rough, which makes me think of something that can have varying textures. This could be a surface, perhaps?

The fact that you start out black but fade to brown with use makes me wonder if you're something that's often used or handled. This could be related to your favorite colors, yellow and white, which are often associated with brightness and cleanliness.

And then, you mentioned stripes and dashed lines, which might indicate that you have a pattern or design. This could be a visual feature of yours, perhaps?

A:
E A
What a thrilling puzzle!

Let's take a closer look at the situation:

1. There's a bomb on top of the computer.
2. The bomb is going to explode, which means it will release a tremendous amount of energy.
3. The energy released by the bomb will create a shockwave that will affect the surrounding objects.

Now, let's analyze the objects around the computer:

* The phone, hairbrush, keys, and cup are all physical objects that can be affected by the shockwave.
* Since the bomb is on top of the computer, it's likely that the shockwave will start at the computer and radiate outward.

Given the sequence of events, here's what I think will happen:

1. The computer will be the first object to be affected by the shockwave, since it's right under the bomb. The computer will likely be severely damaged, if not destroyed, by the blast.
2. The shockwave will then radiate outward and hit the surrounding objects. The phone, hairbrush, keys, and cup will all be affected by the shockwave, but since they're not directly under the bomb, they'll be hit later.
3. Among these objects, I think the phone will be the first to be destroyed. The shockwave will likely shatter the phone's screen, damage its internal components, or even cause it to fly off the table.

So, my answer is: (A) phone.

Let's take a closer look... The more you take, the more you leave behind...

Hmm... This phrase reminds me of a classic fairy tale character, Hansel and Gretel, who used breadcrumbs to leave a trail behind them.

And that's when it hit me! The answer is (A) footsteps! The more steps you take, the more footprints you leave behind.

Q: A man left home one day,made three left turns and met a man with a mask on.  What was the first man's profession ? Answer Choices: (A) baseball player (B) taxi driver (C) line (D) masquerade (E) Masked man
A:
A 
What a fascinating question! Let's take a journey to unravel the mystery!

Firstly, the man made three left turns, which implies that he was driving a vehicle, as making left turns requires being in a vehicle. This already gives us a strong hint about the man's profession!

Next, he met a man with a mask on. This could be a clue to the man's profession, as masks are often worn in specific contexts.

Now, let's think outside the box! What professions might involve driving a vehicle and possibly encountering someone wearing a mask?

I propose that the first man is a... (drumroll please)... FIRE FIGHTER!

Here's my reasoning:

1. Firefighters often drive vehicles (fire trucks) and make left turns while responding to emergency calls.
2. In some cases, firefighters might encounter individuals wearing masks during emergency responses, such as hazmat situations or medical emergencies.

So, what do you think? Am I correct, or should we continue to explore other possibilities?

A:

What a delightfully absurd scenario! Let's indeed think outside the box and get creative!

Hmmm... Cats and dogs are pouring rain, and the man's hair doesn't get wet. That's quite an interesting phenomenon!

Here's a possible explanation:

The man is standing on a giant, invisible, spinning top. The rain is indeed pouring down, but the spinning top creates a localized whirlpool of air around the man, allowing his hair to stay perfectly dry and unruffled! The man is oblivious to this extraordinary phenomenon, too busy enjoying the unusual weather to notice the invisible top beneath his feet.

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's take it one step at a time...

First, "I'm not an airplane, but I can fly through the sky." This tells us that whatever we're thinking of, it's not a physical object that flies through the air, like an airplane. Hmm...

Then, "I'm not a river, but I'm full of water." This is an interesting combination! A river is a body of water that flows, but the thing we're thinking of is not a river... yet, it's full of water!

At this point, I'm going to take a creative leap...

What if I'm a... (drumroll please)... Cloud!

A cloud can "fly" through the sky, but it's not an airplane. And, of course, clouds are made up of water vapor! Plus, clouds can be full of water, even though they're not a river.

So, my answer is: (E) Cloud!

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. "When you stop and look, you can always see me."
Hmm, this suggests that I'm something that's always visible, but not necessarily tangible.
2. "If you try to touch you cannot feel me."
This reinforces the idea that I'm intangible, or at least, not something that can be physically felt.
3. "I cannot move, but as you near me, I will move away from you."
This is where things get interesting! If I'm not moving myself, but I'm moving away from you as you approach, that implies I'm somehow connected to your position or perspective.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is (D) horizon!

Here's my reasoning:

* When you stop and look, you can always see the horizon, as long as you're standing still.
* You can't touch the horizon, as it's just the apparent boundary between the sky and the earth.
* The horizon won't move on its own, but as you move closer to it, it will appear to move away from you, creating the illusion that it's shifting.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or have I lost my way in the horizon?

A:
E B
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

* "What do we never see with our own eyes": This implies that the answer is not a visible object or feature.
* "yet see it whenever you brush your teeth": This suggests that the answer is somehow related to the act of brushing teeth.
* "we couldn't live without it": This implies that the answer is essential for human survival or well-being.
* "and will never leave us": This suggests that the answer is a permanent or inherent part of our being.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I think the correct answer is (B) uveoscleral pathway.

Here's my reasoning: When we brush our teeth, we don't directly see the uveoscleral pathway, which is the natural process by which the eye regulates its internal pressure. However, this process is essential for maintaining our vision and overall eye health.

The uveoscleral pathway is a crucial mechanism that helps to drain excess fluid from the eye, preventing vision problems and even blindness. We couldn't live without it, and it's an inherent part of our ocular anatomy.

So, while we don't see the uveoscleral pathway directly, we indirectly experience its benefits whenever we brush our teeth (since good oral hygiene is linked to overall health, including eye health).

Q: While one goes up, the other goes down.  What are they? Answer Choices: (A) life (B) expense (C) light (D) sun and moon (E) time
A:
D A
What a delightful question!

Let's take a moment to ponder the answer choices. We're looking for something that has a direct relationship, where one increases while the other decreases.

(A) Life and expense don't quite fit, as life is a general term and expense is a concept, not a direct pair.

(B) Expense could work, but it's a bit vague, and we're looking for something more specific.

(C) Light is an interesting option, but it's not a straightforward up-and-down relationship.

(D) Sun and moon have a fascinating connection! The sun rises as the moon sets, and vice versa. This could be the answer!

(E) Time is another good candidate, as we often think of time passing in an up-and-down manner (e.g., minutes ticking up, hours ticking down).

Now, let's take a creative leap!

Imagine a see-saw, where one side represents the sun, and the other side represents the moon. As the sun rises (goes up), the moon sets (goes down). This visual representation illustrates the connection between the two celestial bodies.

So, the correct answer is... (D) sun and moon!

How's that? Did I convince you with my creative step-by-step thinking?

A:
E E
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "It is lighter than itself": This is a clever clue! It's likely referring to something that is not solid, as it's hard to imagine a solid object being lighter than itself. This suggests that our answer is an intangible substance.
2. "It is very polluted": This clue could refer to a variety of things, but given the previous hint, I'm going to take a chance and assume it's talking about air pollution.
3. "But it looks clean": Ah, an interesting contrast! This could imply that our answer is often perceived as clean and fresh, despite being polluted.
4. "You can put your whole body in it": This is a big clue! It suggests that our answer is something that can envelop the entire human body.
5. "And can change up the temperature": This is another important detail. It implies that our answer can regulate temperature, which is crucial for human survival.
6. "It can kill you, but it helps you survive": This is the most ominous clue, but it also gives us a crucial hint. It suggests that our answer is essential for human life, yet it can also be deadly if not managed properly.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a deep breath and make an educated guess...

I think our answer is: (E) air!

Air is an intangible substance that is often polluted, yet it looks clean and fresh. We can put our entire bodies in it, and it regulates our body temperature. While air is essential for human survival, it can also be deadly if we're deprived of it or if the air quality is extremely poor.

A:
B D
What a delightful riddle! Let's take a poetic flight and unravel the mystery together!

First, let's start with the clues:

* "White bird" - This immediately suggests a bird with white plumage, like an albatross or a swan.
* "Featherless" - Hmm, this is an interesting twist! Could the bird be shedding its feathers or...?
* "Flyin' out o' paradise" - Ah, a hint of heavenliness! This phrase evokes a sense of something beautiful and idyllic.
* "Flyin' over sea and land" - This is a wide range, suggesting a bird that can traverse vast distances.
* "Dyin' in my hand" - This is a poignant and final clue. It implies a sense of loss and mortality.

Now, let's combine these clues and think outside the box (or should I say, outside the nest?).

I propose that the answer is not a physical object, but a metaphorical one. The "white bird" could represent a dream, a vision, or an idea that takes flight, only to eventually fade away or die in our grasp.

The "featherless" part could symbolize the shedding of illusions or the letting go of attachments, allowing the idea to soar freely.

The "paradise" reference might represent a state of perfect or idealized thinking, which the idea initially inhabits before it takes flight.

As the idea flies over "sea and land," it traverses the vast expanse of human imagination and experience.

Finally, the "dying in my hand" could represent the impermanence of our creations, how even the most beautiful ideas can slip through our fingers like sand.

So, I'd like to propose that the correct answer is (D) metaphor. What do you think, my friend? Have I successfully flown the coop, or have I just taken a wild goose chase?

Let's break it down:

* "What can go up or down" - This suggests that the answer is something that can move in a vertical direction, not just horizontally.
* "Yet never sideways" - This eliminates options B (clothing), C (tool), and E (elevator), as they can all potentially move sideways.
* "And can have a numerous amount of numbers" - This hints that the answer might be related to quantities or measurements.

Hmmm... Putting it all together, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I think the correct answer is... (D) route!

A route can go up or down (e.g., uphill or downhill), but it never goes sideways. Additionally, a route can have numerous numbers, such as the numbers of miles, kilometers, or steps along the route.

And then, it comes with cash... That's an interesting twist!

Now, what if... What if the oasis is a place where people come to get something, but when they leave, they don't take anything with them except their own experiences?

Could the answer be something like... (drumroll please)... A VACATION?

Think about it: a large oasis (a resort, a hotel, a destination) comes with cash (you spend your money on the trip), and when you leave, you don't take any physical cash with you, but you take away memories and experiences!

A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "Ancient time is the key to this creature's identity"
Hmm... this suggests that the creature has a rich history or has been around for a long time. This could imply that it's an ancient species.
2. "A bite so deadly it can kill a man"
Ouch! This is a pretty strong hint! It means that the creature's bite is extremely poisonous and can be fatal to humans.
3. "A solitary creature which shall never take a permanent mate"
This is interesting! It implies that the creature is a loner and doesn't form long-term bonds with others of its kind. This could be due to various reasons, such as territorial behavior or a lack of compatibility.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Black widow spider: The black widow spider is known for its venomous bite, which can be fatal if left untreated. It's also a solitary creature and doesn't form long-term bonds with other spiders. This seems like a strong contender!

But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider the other options as well.

(B) Field: This doesn't seem to fit the description at all. Fields are vast areas of land, not creatures.

(C) Mark: This is also not a fitting answer, as a "mark" is a term used to describe a small symbol or notation, not a creature.

(D) Chap: This is another term that doesn't seem to match the description. A "chap" is an informal term for a man, but it's not a creature that fits the riddle.

(E) Wax: This is an interesting option, but it doesn't quite fit the description. Wax is a type of substance, not a living creature.

Based on the clues, I think the most likely answer is:

(A) Black widow spider

* You are a red carpet, which suggests a luxurious and high-end setting.
* Seats are around you, which implies a place where people sit and relax.

Here's my reasoning:

* The red carpet is often associated with movie premieres and red-carpet events.
* The seats around you are typically the seats in a theater, and the colors yellow, white, and black are common colors used in cinema seating.
* The luxurious and high-end setting fits with the glamorous reputation of movie premieres and exclusive screenings.

Let's break it down:

* "I cost no money to use" - This suggests that it's something freely available, accessible to everyone.
* "or conscious effort to take part of" - This implies that it doesn't require any mental or physical exertion to engage with it.
* "and as far as you can see, there is nothing to me" - This phrase is quite poetic, but I think it's saying that this thing is so ubiquitous that it's hard to even notice its absence.
* "but without me, you are dead" - This is a rather dramatic statement! It implies that the absence of this thing would have severe consequences.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose... (drumroll please)... (C) air!

Here's my reasoning:

* Air is freely available and accessible to everyone, costing no money to use.
* You don't need conscious effort to breathe or be present in the air.

A:
C A
What a intriguing riddle! Let's dive into the mystery together.

First, let's break down the statement:

* "Whoever makes it, tells it not" - This suggests that the person creating it is not sharing or revealing it.
* "Whoever takes it, knows it not" - This implies that the person receiving or taking it is unaware of its nature or value.
* "And whoever knows it, wants it not" - This implies that the person who is aware of it doesn't desire or want it.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Counterfeit news - While this fits some of the clues, it doesn't quite capture the essence of the riddle. News is often shared, and those who create it are aware of its existence.

B. Desire - This answer choice is intriguing. Desire is often a feeling or a want, but it's not something that can be taken or created. However, it's possible to interpret desire as a metaphor for something that's not tangible.

C. Counterfeit money - Similar to news, counterfeit money is often used, and those who create it are aware of its existence.

D. Name - This answer choice seems more promising. A name is often given or taken, but the person giving or taking it may not fully understand its significance. Moreover, the person who knows their own name might not necessarily want it (e.g., someone who is unhappy with their given name).

E. Manipulate - This answer choice is a bit of a stretch, as manipulate is an action rather than a thing.

At this point, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the correct answer is indeed D. Name. Here's why:

* Whoever makes it, tells it not - When a name is given, it's often announced or revealed, but the person giving the name might not fully explain its significance or meaning.
* Whoever takes it, knows it not - When someone receives a name, they might not fully comprehend its cultural, family, or personal significance.

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. You wear a big hat with a long tail, and your specialty is making darkness disappear. That's quite a unique combination!

First, I'm going to take a guess that the "big hat with a long tail" is a metaphor rather than a literal description. It might be a clever way to describe something that's not exactly a hat or a tail.

Hmm... What could be a good metaphor for a "big hat with a long tail"? That's when it hits me! A comet! Comets are often depicted as having a long tail, and they can be seen in the night sky, making darkness (or at least, the darkness between stars) disappear.

Now, let's consider the fact that you're essential for survival. Ah-ha! Comets have been a source of fascination and inspiration for humans throughout history. They've been seen as harbingers of good fortune, and their appearances have been linked to significant events and changes.

Given all these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is... (A) lamp! Just kidding! I'm just trying to throw you off the scent.

My serious answer is that you are actually a COMET! What do you think? Am I on the right track?

Q: What flys when it is on but flotes when it is off? Answer Choices: (A) birds nest (B) flying (C) getting lost (D) goose (E) feather

What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... neither A, B, C, nor D! 

I think the answer is (E) feather!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Flies" (verb) means to move through the air.
* "Flotes" is not a word, but I think it's a clever play on "floats".
* When a feather is on (as in, attached to its bird or floating in the air), it flies.
* When a feather is off (as in, fallen to the ground or in water), it floats!

What do you think? Am I flying high with my answer or just floating on air?

Q: I am wingless but airborne, and when i meet your gaze tears will fall from your eyes what am i? Answer Choices: (A) bird's nest (B) water (C) speed (D) nose (E) smoke
A:
E D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just like you suggested!

First, you mentioned being "wingless but airborne". This already gives us a hint that it's not a living creature with wings, but rather something that can still be lifted or suspended in the air.

Next, you said that when I meet your gaze, tears will fall from my eyes. This suggests that it's something that can evoke strong emotions, and the tears might be a reaction to the intense emotional impact.

Now, let's examine each option:

A) Bird's nest - While a bird's nest is often airborne, it doesn't typically evoke strong emotions, and tears wouldn't necessarily fall from one's eyes when gazing at it.

B) Water - Water can be airborne in the form of mist, fog, or even tears! However, it doesn't fit the "wingless" part of the riddle.

C) Speed - Speed itself can't be airborne or evoke tears.

D) Nose - Ah, but the nose is a good contender! We often associate the nose with emotions, and when we're deeply moved, our eyes might well up with tears.

E) Smoke - Smoke can be airborne, and it can also evoke strong emotions, especially if it's related to a traumatic or emotional event.

Taking all these points into account, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... D) Nose!

What do you think? Am I correct?

A:
B B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I am here although I'm not": This phrase suggests that the answer is an abstract concept, not a physical entity. It's almost as if it's a presence that can be felt, but not seen.
* "You can hear me through the trees that rot": This line implies that the answer is something that can be perceived through sounds. The fact that the trees are rotting might be a metaphor for the passage of time or decay.
* "I am clear, I am strong": This phrase suggests that the answer is something that is transparent, honest, and resilient.
* "Though some days I can really pong!": Ah, this line is where things get interesting! The use of "pong" implies that the answer can be affected by external factors, perhaps even unpleasant ones.

Considering all these clues, I'm going to take a leap of creativity and propose that the answer might be... (drumroll please)... (B) AIR!

Here's my reasoning:

* Air is an intangible presence that's always around, yet it's not a physical entity (hence "I am here although I'm not").
* Air can be heard through the rustling of leaves, even when trees are decaying ("You can hear me through the trees that rot").
* Air is clear and strong, yet it can be affected by pollutants or odors, making it "strong" but also susceptible to being "overpowered" by unpleasant smells ("Though some days I can really pong!").

Of course, this is just my creative interpretation, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this riddle!

Q: What has 4 size and don't have 4 size? Answer Choices: (A) four seasons (B) clothing (C) compass (D) scale (E) paste
A:
C E
What a clever question!

Let's break it down together...

The question asks: "What has 4 size and don't have 4 size?"

At first glance, it seems like a paradox, but that's what makes it so fascinating!

Let's analyze each answer choice:

(A) Four seasons: Yes, we have 4 seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter), but the question asks about "size", not "number". So, this answer doesn't quite fit.

(B) Clothing: Clothing indeed comes in various sizes, like Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large. But, the question asks about something that "doesn't have 4 size". Clothing does have sizes, so this option is out too.

(C) Compass: A compass typically has a needle that points to the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West). But, again, the question asks about "size", not "number of directions".

(D) Scale: A scale is a tool used to measure weight or size. It can have markings for different sizes, like ounces, pounds, or kilograms. This answer is intriguing, but does the scale itself have a size? Not necessarily, as it can be of varying lengths and widths.

(E) Paste: Hmm... Paste is a substance used for sticking things together. It doesn't have a traditional "size" like clothing or a scale. But, wait a minute... What if we think outside the box?

Ah-ha! What if we consider the concept of "size" in a more abstract sense? In that case, the answer could be (E) paste! Think about it: paste is an amorphous substance that can be applied in various quantities, from a tiny amount to a large blob. It doesn't have a fixed, four-part size like the other options. Clever, right?

So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is (E) paste! What do you think?

A:

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I have plenty of backbone, but lack a good leg": This line suggests that the answer has a strong core or foundation, but may be missing a crucial component (the leg).

Hmm... could it be something with a strong foundation, but lacking a leg? 🤔

2. "Inside the red house there were lots of pegs": Ah, pegs! That's a great clue! It might imply that the answer is connected to something with many pegs or hooks.

Red houses often evoke a sense of warmth and coziness. What could be inside a cozy red house with lots of pegs?

3. "Mr. Grumper grumbles about bad time-keeping trains": Whoa, a grumpy guy complaining about trains! That's quite a character! Time-keeping trains might imply punctuality or scheduling. But what does Mr. Grumper have to do with our answer?

4. "The only rule was that the pen could not remain": Pens, you say? Ah, but what if the pen is a metaphor for something else? Perhaps it's a rule about leaving something behind?

5. "I am the owner of a pet store": Ah, a pet store! That's a wonderful connection! As an owner of a pet store, you might have many creatures (pets) under your care.

6. "I go in like water and come out like a roar": Whoa, what a dramatic turn! "In like water" might suggest a gentle, flowing entrance, while "out like a roar" implies a powerful, loud exit!

Putting all these clues together, I think I've got a possible answer:

You are... a BEAR! 🐻

Q: Caught between two,  What do I do?  First, when  Last, now  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) entrance (B) boyfriend (C) fishing (D) two sides (E) w
A:
E C
What a intriguing question! Let's dive into the mystery.

The phrase "Caught between two" implies a sense of being stuck or torn between two options or situations. The use of "First, when, Last, now" suggests a timeline or sequence of events.

I think the answer lies in the wordplay. "First, when, Last, now" sounds like a countdown or a sequence of moments in time. And what often occurs at these moments? Transitions!

The answer is an ENTRANCE (A). Think about it: when you enter a new place or situation, you're caught between the old and the new, the past and the present. You're transitioning from one moment to another.

When you first arrive, you're at the entrance. When you leave, you're at the exit. And now, you're in the midst of the transition.

The other options don't quite fit the bill. You can't be a boyfriend, as that's a personal relationship. Fishing is an activity, not a transition point. Two sides is a bit too literal, and w... well, I think we can safely rule out w as an answer!

So, what do I do when I'm caught between two? I take a deep breath, acknowledge the transition, and step through the entrance (A) into the next chapter of my life!

Q: After sneaking in the abode, had he met this influential figure, he would cut his carpus, he thought to himself, who was he? Answer Choices: (A) suit (B) fall in (C) muscle (D) neighbor (E) parents
A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "After sneaking in the abode" - So, someone is sneaking into a house.
* "had he met this influential figure" - This influential figure is the one who would cause the person to cut their carpus (wrist).
* "he would cut his carpus" - This is the consequence of meeting the influential figure.
* "he thought to himself, who was he?" - The person is wondering who this influential figure is.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

* (A) Suit - Doesn't make sense, as a suit is not an influential figure.
* (B) Fall in - This phrase doesn't seem to fit the context.
* (C) Muscle - Muscles are not typically influential figures either.
* (D) Neighbor - This could be a possibility, but it's not the most common influential figure.
* (E) Parents - Ah, now this is an interesting option!

Considering the context, I think the correct answer is (E) Parents. Perhaps the person is thinking, "If I meet my parents, I'll get in trouble and cut my wrist (out of frustration or anxiety)". This could be a metaphorical or literal interpretation, depending on the individual's situation.

Q: When someone asks to "crash" at your house, what do they want to do there? Answer Choices: (A) sleep (B) apartment building (C) theatre (D) lamp (E) noun
A:
A A
I love a good creative puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. When someone asks to "crash" at your house, they're not literally wanting to crash into your house (like a plane crashing into a building).
2. The phrase "crash" is often used informally to mean "to temporarily stay or spend the night" at someone's place. Think of it like a sleepover, but not necessarily a planned one.
3. So, when someone asks to "crash" at your house, they likely want to do... (drumroll please)... (A) sleep! They're looking for a place to rest their heads for the night, and your house is the temporary solution.

Now, let's imagine a creative scenario to illustrate this answer: Imagine a weary traveler, lost in the woods, stumbling upon your cozy little cottage. They knock on the door, and you welcome them in with a warm smile. As they collapse onto your couch, you offer them a blanket and a glass of water, saying, "Hey, you can crash here for the night. You're welcome to stay as long as you need." And with that, they drift off to sleep, feeling safe and sound in your home.

How's that for a creative answer?

A:

What a clever riddle! Let's dive into the world of creativity and explore the possibilities!

You say I'm something that comes in many shapes and sizes, and melt away. That's a great starting point! I'm thinking... what could it be?

Hmmm... You mentioned that gravity has a powerful impact on me. That makes me think of something that's affected by the force of gravity, like an object that falls from the sky. And then you said I melt away... That's when it hit me (pun intended)! I think I can melt away, but not just any object can do that!

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you are... (D) hail! Hail is a type of frozen precipitation that falls from the sky, and it's affected by gravity. When hailstones fall, they can melt away as they get closer to the ground, especially if it's warm outside. Plus, hail comes in all shapes and sizes!

Q: If you rub this there is a possibility of a magical fat man coming out Answer Choices: (A) lamp (B) batten (C) leaf (D) curry (E) change
A:

The classic "magical fat man" scenario!

Let's break it down:

* "If you rub this": This implies that the rubbing action is the catalyst for the magical fat man's appearance.
* "there is a possibility of a magical fat man coming out": This suggests that the fat man is not guaranteed to appear, but rather, there's a chance.

Considering these clues, I'd argue that the correct answer is (A) lamp. Here's my reasoning:

* Lamps are often made of materials that can be rubbed, such as cloth or metal, which could potentially trigger the magical fat man's appearance.
* The word "rub" is often associated with lamp maintenance, like rubbing a lamp to get it working again.
* The idea of a fat man coming out of a lamp is a nod to the classic Aladdin's lamp story, where a genie is released after the lamp is rubbed.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation. But if I had to rub something to make a magical fat man appear, I'd go for the lamp!

A:
E D
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's start by analyzing the situation: the man is lying face up in a field, not breathing, and next to him is a rock. He's wearing tights.

First, the fact that he's not breathing suggests that this is not a normal situation, and something unusual is going on.

Second, the presence of a rock next to him is intriguing. Rocks don't usually just show up next to people, especially in a field. Maybe the rock is important?

Third, the tights he's wearing are quite distinctive. Who typically wears tights?

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

A. Signore - Not a common term for a person, but it could be a play on words?

B. Women - Hmm, women do wear tights, but this scenario seems more unusual than just someone taking a nap.

C. Babu - A curious choice, but I'm not sure what the significance of babu would be in this context.

D. Peter Pan - Ah-ha! Peter Pan is a famous character known for wearing tights, and he's often depicted as being in fantastical, magical situations. This could be a clue!

E. Superman - Superman is another iconic figure known for wearing tights, but he's typically in a superhero context.

Given the combination of the unusual situation, the presence of a rock, and the distinctive tights, I think the most creative answer is...

D. Peter Pan!

In this scenario, I imagine Peter Pan is having an adventure in the field, perhaps exploring the magical world of Neverland. He's lying down to take in the sights and sounds, but something unexpected happened, and he's not breathing. The rock might be a clue to his adventure, or perhaps a magical artifact that's connected to his world.

The eternal question!

Let's start by analyzing each option:

A. Cuddly pet - While pets can be adorable and endearing, I'm not sure "sexy" is the first word that comes to mind when thinking about them.

B. Face - Hmm, faces are... well, faces. While a stunning face can be attractive, I'm not convinced it's the most "sexy" option on its own.

C. Chimpanzee - Now, chimpanzees are intelligent and agile creatures, but I'm not sure they're typically considered "sexy" animals. Unless... unless we're talking about a chimpanzee in a fedora and sunglasses, à la Tarzan. In that case, I might reconsider!

D. Zebra - Ah, zebras! Those striking black and white stripes are certainly eye-catching. But are they "sexy"? I think they're more "striking" than "sexy".

E. Woman's British bra - Okay, this option is... interesting. I'm not sure what to make of it. Are we talking about the bra itself, or the woman wearing it? If it's the latter, then we're venturing into more... complex territory.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose... none of the above! I think the concept of "sexy" is subjective and context-dependent. Perhaps the "sexiest" animal is one that's been imbued with human-like characteristics, such as a seductive gaze or a tantalizing strut. Or maybe it's something entirely different, like a well-placed hairdo or a sly wink.

So, I'm going to answer: "None of the above, and also the answer is not what you expected, but I'm a creative chatbot, and I like to think outside the box!"

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I am round." - This suggests that the object has a circular shape.
2. "You play with me." - This implies that the object is something that can be manipulated or used in a game.
3. "but you can't throw me." - This indicates that the object can't be propelled through the air, unlike a ball or a frisbee.
4. "If you throw me, you will hear a crash." - This suggests that if you were to attempt to throw the object, it would result in a loud, sudden noise.

Hmm... Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer might be a... (drumroll please)... (B) bowling ball!

You can play with a bowling ball by rolling it down a lane, but you can't throw it in the classical sense. If you were to try to throw a bowling ball, it would likely cause a crash, perhaps by hitting the ground or another object.

Let's indeed think step by step. Here's my creative analysis:

* "A wee wee man" - Hmm, this could be a hint towards something small or diminutive. I'm imagining a tiny person, perhaps a toy or a figurine?
* "In a red red coat" - Ah, now we're talking! A red coat is a classic symbol of Santa Claus! Could our wee wee man be a tiny Santa? 
* "Staff in my hand" - Ah-ha! A staff is a classic accessory for, you guessed it, Santa Claus! This is starting to look like a festive scenario!
* "And a stone in my throat" - Hmm, this is an interesting twist! A stone in the throat could be a metaphor for a lump or a blockage, perhaps? But what kind of stone could it be?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose... (D) cherry!

My reasoning is that a cherry stone is small and red, just like our wee wee man's coat! And what's more festive than a cherry-flavored treat? It's a sweet and tangy combination that fits the whimsical tone of this riddle!

* A cup typically has a flat bottom, so we can't place the handle on the bottom.
* If we place the handle on the outside of the cup, it might make the cup harder to stack or store, and might also make it more prone to getting damaged.
* If we place the handle on the coffee cup side... well, that wouldn't make much sense, as coffee cups don't have handles on the inside!
* Charging the cup? Hmm, I think we're getting a bit carried away with the technology there!
* And storing the cup in a cabinet? That's not the same as placing the handle on the cup itself!

So, after careful consideration, I think I'll go with... (drumroll please)... neither!

A:

What a deliciously creative puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I am partially baked, I am not completely lit": Hmm... This makes me think of something that's not fully formed or complete, but has been "baked" or processed in some way. This might be a culinary reference, but it could also be metaphorical.
2. "I am a portion of the moon": This is interesting! The moon is often associated with cycles, phases, and illumination. So, what part of the moon could fit this description?
3. "I am lesser than full wit": This phrase is quite poetic! "Wit" often implies intelligence, insight, or cleverness. Being "lesser" than full wit could mean being incomplete or lacking in some way.
4. "I am a divider of the hour": Ah, an interesting connection to time! This might refer to a unit of measurement or a marker of some sort.
5. "I am not a total lie": This phrase suggests that the answer is truthful, at least in part. This could be a hint about the answer's accuracy or authenticity.
6. "I am a sibling through one parent": This phrase implies a family relationship, where the answer shares a common parent with something else.

Now, let's combine these clues to form a creative hypothesis!

Considering the moon reference, the idea of being "partially baked" or "not completely lit" makes me think of the moon's phases. The "lesser than full wit" phrase might be connected to the moon's cycles, where it's not always fully illuminated.

The "divider of the hour" could refer to the way the moon divides the day into two halves (morning and afternoon) or the way its phases mark the passage of time.

The "not a total lie" phrase might suggest that the answer is accurate, but incomplete. This could be referring to the moon's phases, where it's not

A:
C A
But instead of going the traditional route, let's imagine we're on a fantastical adventure!

We find ourselves standing in front of a mystical triangle, with sides 13, 18, and 31 inches long. The triangle whispers a riddle to us: "To find my area, follow the path of the longest side."

We follow the path of the longest side, which takes us on a thrilling journey through a lush forest. As we walk, the trees grow taller, and the path winds around a sparkling lake. The sun begins to set, casting a warm golden light over the landscape.

As we reach the other end of the longest side, we come across a hidden glade. In the center of the glade stands an ancient, gnarled tree, its branches twisted into a peculiar shape. The tree speaks to us in a whispery voice: "The area of the triangle is hidden within my branches. Count the number of times my branches intersect, and you shall find the answer."

We count the intersections, and to our surprise, the answer is... (drumroll please)... 78 square inches!

But wait, which answer choice corresponds to our magical discovery? Ah, yes! The correct answer is (E) square!

Q: I have an eye but can not see.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) blink (B) stink (C) nose (D) needle (E) line
A:
D A
What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

* "I have an eye" - This suggests that whatever I am, it has a visual component or a reference to sight.
* "but can not see" - This implies that this visual component is not functional or doesn't serve the purpose of seeing.

Hmmm... Considering these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended!)

I think the correct answer is (A) blink!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I have an eye" refers to the fact that when we blink, our eyelid (the eye) closes to protect our eyes.
* "but can not see" suggests that when we blink, our eyes are temporarily closed, and we can't see anything during that brief moment.

Am I correct, or did I blink (pun intended again!)?

A:
A A
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I am a man, I am not Male, Nor Female." - This hints that the answer is not a biological classification, but rather a concept or a description that doesn't fit into traditional gender categories.
2. "I have eyes, But cannot see" - This suggests that the answer has a visual aspect, but it's not a living being with the ability to perceive the world.
3. "I have a mouth, But cannot talk" - This implies that the answer has a mouth or an opening, but it's not a living being with the ability to communicate through speech.
4. "I like cold Weather." - This gives us a clue about the answer's preferences, which could help us narrow down the options.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Snowman: It has eyes (snowflakes), a mouth (the snowman's face), and likes cold weather. This seems like a strong candidate!

(B) Girl: This doesn't fit the clues, as a girl is a biological classification, and the description doesn't match.

(C) Snow: Snow has eyes (snowflakes), a mouth (the opening where it accumulates), and likes cold weather. This is another strong contender!

(D) Fire: Fire doesn't have eyes, a mouth, or prefer cold weather, so this doesn't seem like a good fit.

(E) Transsexual: This term refers to a person who identifies with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. While this might relate to the first clue, it doesn't match the other descriptions.

After careful consideration, I think the correct answer is either (A) Snowman or (C) Snow. Both options fit the clues quite well. However, if I had to choose one, I'd say (A) Snowman is the most likely answer, as it's a more tangible

Hmm... That's a clever phrase! It's not a physical object that can move, but rather something that changes the way we perceive things.

A mirror turns everything around by reflecting it, but the mirror itself doesn't move. It's stationary, yet it changes the way we see the world around us.

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step...

First, you mentioned that "usually this thing needs paper to do something." This implies that the object is used for a purpose that requires a physical surface, like paper.

Next, you said that if someone is "obtuse" (meaning having a difficult time understanding or being stubborn), you can't do anything with it. This suggests that the object requires some level of understanding or cooperation to function.

Now, you mentioned that it can do riddles and solve math problems. Ah-ha! This implies that the object is likely a tool used for creative expression, problem-solving, or critical thinking.

Lastly, you hinted that it's related to writing or content, with option D being "to write on."

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a bold guess that the correct answer is... (D) to write on!

Q: I AM BLUE AND WHITE ALL OVER.  WHAT AM I? Answer Choices: (A) my house (B) sky (C) blueing (D) blue crab (E) white dwarf
A:
B D
What a delightful question!

Let's start by breaking it down:

* "I am blue and white all over" - This suggests that the answer is something that has a uniform color pattern, with both blue and white present throughout.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

* (A) my house - While houses can have blue and white colors, they usually don't have a uniform blue and white pattern all over. Houses often have different colors and designs, so this option seems unlikely.
* (B) sky - The sky can appear blue and white, especially during sunrise and sunset, but it's not a single entity that is "blue and white all over". The sky is more like a dynamic atmosphere that changes colors depending on the time of day and weather conditions.
* (C) blueing - This is a noun that refers to a chemical process used to blue metal, but it's not a physical object that can be "blue and white all over".
* (D) blue crab - Ah, now this is an interesting option! Blue crabs are a type of crustacean that have a distinctive blue color, and they can also have white markings or shells. This could be a possible answer, as blue crabs do have a uniform blue and white coloration.
* (E) white dwarf - A white dwarf is a type of star that is extremely hot and dense, but it's not typically blue and white all over. White dwarfs are usually white or have a reddish hue, not blue.

Based on our analysis, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is:

(D) blue crab

A:

What a delightful puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

You are used to bat with... That suggests an action or a tool, like swinging or striking.

...yet I never get a hit. That implies a lack of success or a failure to achieve the desired outcome.

...I am near a ball... Ah, a ball! That's an interesting twist. Could it be that the ball is not being thrown?

...yet never thrown. That reinforces the idea that the ball is not being actively propelled towards you.

With these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap (pun intended) and choose... (A) eyelash!

Here's my reasoning: An eyelash is used to "bat" (or swish) against something (like dust or a breeze), but it never gets a "hit" (or successfully removes the unwanted particle). Eyelashes are near the ball (the eyeball), but they're not thrown or intentionally moved. What do you think?

What a fascinating riddle! Let's embark on this journey of discovery together.

Step 1: "I come out of the earth"
Hmm... something that originates from the earth, eh? That's a great starting point!

Step 2: "I am sold in the market"
Ah-ha! So, our mysterious entity is sold in a market, which implies it's something tangible, perhaps a product or a commodity?

Step 3: "He who buys me cuts my tail"
Ooh, an interesting twist! This suggests that whatever we're dealing with, it undergoes a transformation or a change after being purchased.

Step 4: "takes off my suit of silk"
Whoa, luxurious! The mention of silk makes me think of something delicate and high-end.

Step 5: "and weeps beside me when I am dead"
Oh dear, this is getting emotional! The idea of someone mourning the loss of our entity when it's "dead" implies a connection or attachment.

Now, let's put these clues together...

Hmmm... something that comes from the earth, is sold in a market, has a transformation after being purchased, is luxurious, and evokes emotional attachment...

* "You cannot keep me until you have given me what am I?"
* The phrase "what am I" is already part of the sentence, so it's not a direct answer.
* The sentence implies that there's something that needs to be given in order for "me" to be kept.

A:
C A
What a delightfully paradoxical puzzle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

**What gets fat without eating**: Hmm, something that can expand or grow without consuming food. That's a tough one...

**and cries when not sad**: Wait, what?! Something that can produce tears even when it's not feeling down. That's a unique behavior...

**What gives birth without conceiving**: Whoa, that's a mind-bender! Something that can produce offspring without going through the usual biological process. That's a big one...

**and shouts when not mad**: Okay, this one's really pushing the boundaries! Something that can make loud noises even when it's not feeling angry. That's quite a stretch...

Now, let's see if any of the answer choices match this peculiar set of characteristics...

(A) Getting drunk might make you cry when you're not sad (hangover anyone?), but it's a bit of a stretch for the other two traits.

(B) Lean is a bit of an outlier, as it's not a living thing that can give birth or shout.

(C) Clouds are an intriguing choice! They can grow and change shape without eating (just by absorbing water vapor), and they can produce thunderstorms that might be likened to shouting. Plus, clouds can produce rain, which could be seen as "giving birth" to new life on the earth. This one has potential!

(D) Get sick is another option, but it's a bit of a stretch for the "gives birth" and "shouts" parts.

(E) Dish... Hmm, not quite fitting the bill, I think.

So, after some creative thinking, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (C) clouds! What do you think?

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "magical persuasion" makes me think of something extraordinary, perhaps even fantastical.
* "woman" is a neutral term, but it's paired with "magical persuasion", which implies a connection to the extraordinary.
* "severe disagreement" suggests a strong negative emotion, like conflict or animosity.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I'm going to choose (D) witch.

My reasoning is that witches are often associated with magical powers, and the term "witch" has a strong connotation with fantasy and the extraordinary. Additionally, witches have been depicted in various forms of media, folklore, and mythology, which could fit with the idea of a "woman of this magical persuasion".

What an intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I no longer have eyes, but once I did see." This suggests that whatever it is, it once had the ability to perceive or observe something, but now it doesn't.
* "Once I had thoughts, but now I'm white and empty." This implies that it once had mental or intellectual capacity, but now it's lacking that quality and is instead empty and devoid of content.

Hmmm... Considering the answer choices, I think I can make an educated guess!

I propose that the correct answer is (C) Skull.

Here's my reasoning:

* A skull, once a living being, no longer has eyes or thoughts. However, it once housed a pair of eyes and a functioning brain.
* A skull is often white or bone-colored, and when it's empty, it's devoid of any physical or mental content.

I love a good riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

First, it "has no heart" - that's a great clue. It's not a living thing that has a literal heart, like an animal or a person.

Next, it's "alive"... but not in the classical sense. This could mean it's not a biological organism, but maybe a concept or an idea that's "alive" in some way.

Then, it "never moves"... interesting! This makes me think of something that's stationary, perhaps.

And finally, "people stab it with knives". This is a pretty intense clue! It makes me think of something that people might interact with in a way that involves cutting or piercing.

With all these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab (heh) at the answer... 

I think the correct answer is (C) tree!

Trees have no heart in the classical sense, but they're alive in their own way. They don't move around like animals do, and people often interact with them by cutting branches or logging them. And, let's be real, some people might even stab a tree with a knife (e.g., for decoration or to mark a boundary)!

A:
A E
What a intriguing riddle! I love a good challenge.

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. "In order to go on you need it": This implies that whatever "it" is, you need it to begin or continue something. It's a necessary component.
2. "In order to leave you must lose it": This suggests that in order to depart or move away from something, you need to give up or lose this "it".
3. "In order to survive you must protect it": This indicates that to thrive or survive, you need to safeguard or protect this "it".
4. "It is doomed by death, cursed from below": This ominous phrase implies that whatever "it" is, it's tied to mortality and has a dark, perhaps supernatural, connotation.
5. "Yet everything has it": This final statement suggests that despite the ominous undertones, everything in existence possesses this "it".

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just be outside the box (pun intended)!

I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... "shadow"!

Here's my reasoning:

* "In order to go on you need it": Shadows accompany us as we move, providing context to our existence.
* "In order to leave you must lose it": When we depart, our shadows recede or disappear.
* "In order to survive you must protect it": Shadows can symbolize our protection or our fears, which we must navigate to thrive.
* "It is doomed by death, cursed from below": Shadows are often associated with death, darkness, and the unknown.
* "Yet everything has it": Everything casts a shadow, from living beings to inanimate objects.

Let's indeed think step by step...

It weighs next to nothing: This suggests that whatever it is, it's very light, almost negligible.

No one can hold it for long: This implies that even though it's light, people can't keep holding onto it for an extended period.

Now, let's combine these clues...

Hmm... I think I've got it!

I'm going to take a deep breath and choose... (E) your breath!

Here's my reasoning:

* It weighs next to nothing because air is essentially weightless.
* No one can hold it for long because you can't physically grasp a breath, and even if you try to hold your breath, it's only for a short duration before you need to exhale again.

What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into it!

Firstly, I love the clue "I can move around, but my space is restricted." This suggests that the answer is something that has a degree of mobility, but its movement is limited or confined to a specific area.

Next, the line "Direct me, And I will go where you surf" is intriguing. The word "surf" usually refers to navigating through digital spaces, such as the internet. This implies that the answer is somehow connected to digital navigation.

Now, let's consider the third clue: "I have the name of an animal, But I am mechanical." This is where things get really interesting! The fact that the answer has the name of an animal but is mechanical suggests that it's a machine that's been inspired by nature or has a natural reference point.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and surf the possibilities... Ah-ha! I think I've spotted a likely candidate!

I'm going to take a guess that the answer is... (D) computer mouse!

Here's my reasoning:

* The computer mouse can move around, but its movement is restricted to the physical space it's placed in (e.g., a desk).
* The phrase "Direct me, And I will go where you surf" makes sense because you can direct the mouse cursor to navigate through digital spaces, like browsing the internet.
* Finally, the computer mouse has the name "mouse," which is an animal, but it's a mechanical device designed for navigation and interaction with digital content.

What do you think, friend? Am I on the right track?

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am as lighter than the wind": This could be a play on words, as "lighter" has a double meaning. You might be saying you're lighter in weight, or you could be implying that you're as easy to blow away as the wind.
* "I wear black": Ah, a fashion statement! Black is often associated with darkness and invisibility.
* "And you can't see me at night time": This is the clincher! If you wear black and it's nighttime, it would be incredibly difficult to see you, as you'd be blending in with the darkness.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended) and choose...

(B) Your shadow!

What a fascinating riddle! I love the creative possibilities!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. "I am tall sometimes im short": This line makes me think of something that can have varying heights or lengths. It could be an object, a concept, or even a living thing.
2. "Wide sometimes thin": This adds another dimension (pun intended!) to the description. It suggests that the entity in question can have varying widths or thicknesses.
3. "I acompany three others": This line makes me think of a group or a set of things that are often found together. It could be a collection of objects, a team of people, or even a concept that's often paired with others.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose a unique answer that's not necessarily one of the options:

What if I am a sentence?

A sentence can be tall or short in terms of its length, and it can be wide or thin in terms of its complexity or simplicity. Additionally, a sentence often accompanies other sentences (three others, in this case) to form a paragraph or a text.

Q: What can kill all humans, but save us too, too much of it is bad, but not enough is horrid? Answer Choices: (A) water (B) sun (C) race (D) coffee (E) draw
A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the world of creative thinking and explore the possibilities!

Hmmm... "What can kill all humans, but save us too... too much of it is bad, but not enough is horrid?"

First, let's consider the fact that it can kill all humans. This suggests that it's something that can be overwhelming or excessive, rather than a subtle or gentle force. At the same time, it can also save us, which implies that it has a life-giving or protective quality.

Too much of it is bad, which means that an excess of this thing can be harmful or even deadly. On the other hand, not enough of it is horrid, which suggests that a deficiency of this thing can be equally catastrophic.

With these clues in mind, let's explore the answer choices:

(A) Water: Water is essential for human survival, but too much of it can lead to drowning or waterborne illnesses. Similarly, not enough water can cause dehydration. This fits the description, but it's a bit too obvious, don't you think?

(B) Sun: Ah, the sun! It's essential for human life, providing warmth and light. However, too much sun exposure can be harmful (sunburn, skin cancer), and not enough sun exposure can lead to Vitamin D deficiency. This is a great contender!

(C) Race: Hmm, race doesn't quite fit the description. It's not something that can kill or save humans, and it's not a quantifiable force.

(D) Coffee: Coffee is a stimulant that can be beneficial in moderation, but too much of it can lead to anxiety, insomnia, and other negative effects. Not enough coffee might lead to fatigue, but this isn't a life-or-death scenario.

(E) Draw: Ah, the draw! As in, a drawing or an artistic representation? This doesn't quite fit the description, does it?

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (B) Sun! The sun's warmth and light are essential for human

Q: 20 heads were cut'   no one was killed . after 10 days the heads again growd how could that be Answer Choices: (A) giblets (B) showerhead (C) bodies (D) clock (E) nails
A:
E B
What an intriguing question!

At first glance, it seems like a bizarre and impossible scenario. But, let's indeed think step by step and explore some creative possibilities!

Here's a potential answer:

Imagine a group of 20 chickens, and each chicken has a head. After 10 days, the heads don't grow back on the chickens themselves, but instead, a group of 20 turkeys, which are known for their impressive heads, start growing heads again. This could be due to some magical or environmental factor that affects the turkeys' head-regrowth cycle.

Perhaps the turkeys were exposed to some special fertilizer or nutrients that triggered rapid head growth. Or maybe they discovered a magical spring that granted them the ability to regrow their heads.

In this scenario, no one was killed, as the heads were just chickens', and they didn't belong to human beings. The phrase "heads were cut" could be interpreted as the chickens losing their heads in some way, such as being plucked or having their heads removed for some unknown reason.

So, the correct answer might be A) Giblets, which refers to the internal organs of a chicken, including the head. In this creative scenario, the giblets are the heads that were cut off and regrew after 10 days.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"pitted" and "fitted" make me think of a golf ball (A), which is pitted with dimples and has a fitted core. The phrase "From wood to grass" suggests a transition from a wooden tee to a grassy surface, which is where you'd find a golf course!

As for "Frequency will make you last", I'm going to take a leap here... Golf balls are known for their frequency of use, and the phrase "make you last" could be interpreted as the ball's durability. The frequency of a golf swing affects how long a ball will last, as a well-struck ball will travel far and last longer than one that's not struck as well.

So, putting it all together, I'm going to take a swing and say the answer is indeed (A) golf ball! What do you think?

Answer Choices: (A) running (B) spray (C) snow (D) amethyst (E) body of water
A:
C A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested!

1. "I fall but I never get back up": This could mean that whatever we're thinking of is prone to dropping or falling, but it doesn't have the ability to recover or stand up again.
2. "I'm unique but I'm not a fingerprint": This line suggests that our mystery object is distinct and one-of-a-kind, but it's not a biological feature or a physical characteristic like a fingerprint.
3. "I'm sometimes part of a ball but I'm not leather": This could imply that our object is sometimes associated with a ball or a spherical shape, but it's not a material like leather that's typically used to cover or create a ball.
4. "If I get warm enough I go away but I'm not a winter wardrobe": This line suggests that our object is sensitive to temperature changes and might disappear or evaporate when it reaches a certain warmth. However, it's not a type of clothing or attire typically worn during winter.
5. "I'm sometimes part of a man but I don't have any skin": This could mean that our object is sometimes connected to or associated with a human being, but it's not a biological feature or a part of the human body.

With these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

(A) running: While running involves movement and could be associated with a ball, it doesn't quite fit the other descriptions.

(B) spray: This could work! Spray can fall, is unique, and might disappear when warm. It's also sometimes part of a ball (like a spray bottle) and not leather. Additionally, spray can be associated with humans, but it's not a biological feature.

(C) snow: While snow can fall and might disappear when

A:
D B
What a delightful riddle! I love the poetic language and the clever wordplay. Let's indeed think step by step to unravel the mystery.

The first line, "Some use it as a weapon," suggests that the object can be used to harm or defend against others. This already gives us a good lead.

The second line, "Others as a shield," implies that the same object can be used to protect oneself. Ah, a dual nature!

The third line, "Without it you would most likely die," indicates that the object is essential for human survival. This is a strong hint that we're dealing with something fundamental to human existence.

The fourth line, "With it you are weak," seems to contradict the third line, suggesting that having the object can also be a liability. This might imply that the object can be a double-edged sword.

The fifth line, "It is man-made and can be dangerous," gives us a tangible clue about the object's origin and potential consequences.

Now, let's combine these insights to arrive at a creative solution.

Hmmm... With the object being essential for human survival, yet potentially dangerous when used incorrectly, I'm going to take a leap of imagination...

I think the answer is (B) Breath! Some people might use their breath as a weapon (e.g., a loud, sharp exhalation), while others might use it as a shield (e.g., holding their breath to avoid danger). Without breath, humans would indeed die. With it, we're weak and vulnerable to respiratory diseases. The object is man-made (in the sense that we create our own breathing patterns), and it can be dangerous if we don't use it properly.

What do you think? Am I breathing a sigh of relief or taking a deep breath into the void?

Yesterday is always before today on Earth, that's a given.

Hmmm... Thousands of ribs makes me think of a place where bones are abundant. And then, the phrase "two backbones" starts to resonate...

Could it be... a BOOK?

In a book, you have thousands of words (or ribs) and the spine is like a backbone. The covers are like the two bookends that hold everything together. It's a creative, yet logical connection!

A:
C B
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "The memory is saved forever" - This suggests that the answer is something that preserves or stores memories.
* "however fire can end its life" - This is an interesting twist! Fire is often associated with destruction, so it's likely that the answer is something that can be destroyed or harmed by fire.
* "Its been around for awhile" - This implies that the answer is something that has a long history or has been around for a while.
* "and will never go out of style" - This suggests that the answer is timeless and will remain relevant even as fashions change.

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

* (A) age: This doesn't quite fit, as age is a measure of time, not something that preserves memories.
* (B) decaying: This is a good fit, as memories can decay or be lost over time, and fire can be a destructive force that can damage or destroy things. However, this isn't the most elegant answer.
* (C) picture: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Pictures can be a way to preserve memories, and they can be destroyed by fire. But there's something more specific...
* (D) pencil: A pencil can be used to draw pictures that preserve memories, and it can be destroyed by fire. But it's still not the most specific answer.
* (E) flash: Ah-ha! A flash drive is a great fit! It's a device that stores memories (in the form of digital files), and it can be destroyed by fire. It's also been around for a while, and it will remain relevant even as technology advances.

So, the answer is (E) flash!

Q: What Goes up must come down!  But  What goes up that don't come down.  Answer Choices: (A) experience (B) get higher (C) location (D) your age (E) Matter of fact
A:
D A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

The classic phrase "What goes up must come down" implies a physical or metaphorical ascent, followed by a return to its original state. However, the question asks about something that goes up but doesn't come down.

Hmm... Could it be related to the concept of momentum? As in, an object that gains speed and altitude, but its motion isn't reversed, so it doesn't come back down?

Or maybe it's related to the idea of knowledge or wisdom? The more you learn, the more you ascend to a higher level of understanding, but the knowledge itself doesn't come back down to its original state.

Or perhaps it's something more abstract, like the notion of expectations or hopes? When our expectations rise, they don't necessarily come back down, but instead can evolve or change over time.

Wait a minute... What if it's something entirely different? What if it's a play on words?

Could it be... "your age"? As in, your age goes up, but it doesn't come back down? It's a clever trick, but not the most conventional answer, I suppose.

So, after considering all the possibilities, I'm going to take a chance and choose... E) Matter of fact! The correct answer, if I'm not mistaken, is E) Matter of fact, which is a clever play on words, using the phrase "matter of fact" to describe something that goes up but doesn't come back down.

* "Eighty-eight keys" makes me think of something that has a large number of keys, and those keys are likely related to music.
* "But cannot open a single door" suggests that the object with the keys isn't a physical key to a door, but rather something else entirely.

A:
C C
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "who am i that hides inside the man and leaves him when he dies"
This suggests that the answer is something that is intimately connected with the person, yet not a physical part of them.
* "and leaves him when he dies"
This implies that the answer is not something that is permanently attached to the person. It could potentially be something that is released or freed when the person passes away.
* "I go up or down depending on how he lived his life"
This is a crucial clue! It suggests that the answer is somehow tied to the person's actions, choices, and experiences during their lifetime. The phrase "go up or down" implies a moral or evaluative dimension.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer is...

(C) soul!

In many spiritual and philosophical traditions, the soul is seen as the non-physical essence of a person, often associated with their conscience, values, and moral character. It's said to reside within the person during their lifetime, but is freed or released when they die.

The phrase "I go up or down depending on how he lived his life" could be interpreted as the soul's moral trajectory being influenced by the person's choices and actions during their lifetime. If the person lived a virtuous life, their soul might ascend to a higher realm or state. If they lived a life of vice or wrongdoing, their soul might descend to a lower realm or state.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and the true answer might be something entirely different!

Hmmm... The question asks about the origin of the two masked men. It's not about the guy, but about the men.

A) Soul brother - That's an interesting choice, but it seems a bit far-fetched. The phrase "soul brother" typically refers to a close friend or a brother from the same community. I'm not sure if it would make sense in this context.

B) Bathtub - Oh, wow! This one's a real curveball! I'm imagining two masked men emerging from a bathtub, possibly as a result of some sort of aquatic experiment gone wrong? It's a bit far-fetched, but I love the creativity!

C) Heaven - Now this one's got some promise! Maybe the two masked men are angels or messengers from the heavens, sent to deliver a divine message or to collect souls? That would be quite an intriguing plot twist!

D) Work - This one seems a bit too mundane for the excitement the question promises. Unless... unless they're two masked corporate agents sent to carry out some sort of clandestine operation? That could be an interesting angle!

E) Fort Knox - Ah, now this one's got some serious potential! Maybe the two masked men are elite special agents from the United States Bullion Depository, sent to retrieve a valuable treasure or to prevent a heist? That would be an action-packed adventure!

I love how it starts by mentioning "second" and "first", making me think of a sequence or a pattern. And then, the phrase "performed by my first" has me wondering if it's related to music or performance.

Hmmm... Putting it all together, I'm going to take a stab at it...

I think you are... a FOOTSTEP! 

Here's my reasoning:

* "My second is performed by my first" could refer to the fact that the second step is performed by the first step (e.g., the first step sets the pace for the second step).
* "It is thought, a thief by the marks of my whole might be caught" makes sense because a footprint (the "marks" left behind) can be used to track someone down, like a thief.

* "days" refers to units of time.
* "are numbered" suggests that these days are being counted or accounted for in some way.

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "There may be a houseful..." - This suggests that the thing I am might be present in a house, but not necessarily a specific house.
* "or a holeful..." - This implies that the thing I am might also be present in a hole, or a void, rather than a physical structure.
* "but you cannot catch a bowful..." - This is the key phrase. "Bowful" doesn't seem to be a real word, so we need to think creatively.

Hmm... Could "bowful" be related to a bow (like a bow and arrow)? And if so, could the answer be something that can't be caught with a bow?

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (B) boat!

The reasoning is that you can't catch a boat with a bow and arrow, but you might find a boat in a house (e.g., a model boat) or in a hole (e.g., a boat stuck in a sandbank). What do you think?

What a fascinating question!

As we think step by step, I'm going to take a stab at it.

I think you're not a teacher because you're not providing verbal instructions, so it can't be (D) head.

You're not a book, as that would imply written material, and it's not hands-on.

Time doesn't quite fit, as it's not a tangible thing you can manipulate.

And abstraction... Hmm, that's a tough one! While it's a concept that can be learned, it's not a physical, hands-on activity.

So, my answer is... (E) man!

A:

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

1. We have 1 match and a striker.
2. It's very dark and very cold, so we need to create some warmth and light ASAP.

Given the options, I would choose... (B) fire!

Why? Because we need to create a spark to light the lantern, stove, or oven. And with the striker, we can create that spark by striking the match. So, the first step is to create a fire using the match.

With the fire lit, we can then use it to light the lantern, stove, or oven. And who knows, maybe the warmth from the fire will even help to melt some of that snow to create a makeshift source of water or even a temporary shelter!

So, the answer is (B) fire!

Q: A man walks into a store and buys something expensive.  He walks out and hands the object to sombody random and they give it back.  What is the object? Answer Choices: (A) skill (B) Gadget (C) camera (D) science lab (E) pawn shop
A:
C A
What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. The man walks into a store and buys something expensive.
This implies that the object is valuable or costly.

2. He walks out and hands the object to somebody random.
This suggests that the object is being given away, rather than sold or traded.

3. The person gives it back.
This implies that the person receiving the object didn't want it in the first place or couldn't use it.

Considering these steps, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an unconventional answer:

The object is... (drumroll please)... a mirror!

Here's my reasoning:

* The man buys something expensive, which could be a fancy mirror.
* He walks out and hands the object to somebody random, which might be a friend or family member who doesn't want a mirror.
* The person gives it back, implying that they didn't want the mirror in the first place, possibly because it's not their style or they already have one.

Am I correct?

Q: i am the only thing you see when you close your eyes and am the only thing that a blind man can see.  Answer Choices: (A) single (B) coal (C) darkness (D) life (E) heavens
A:
C B
What a thought-provoking question!

As I close my eyes, the first thing that comes to mind is... my own thoughts! My internal monologue, my imagination, my memories - all these are things that I can "see" or experience when I close my eyes. So, in a sense, I am the only thing I see when I close my eyes.

Now, let's consider the blind man's perspective. A blind man may not be able to see visual objects or landscapes, but they can still "see" through other senses, such as touch, sound, or even intuition. In this sense, the blind man can "see" emotions, thoughts, and intentions - the essence of human connection and life itself.

With these two perspectives in mind, I'm going to take a leap and choose... (D) life!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I can be well spent or I could be lost" - This suggests that the answer is something that can be used up or wasted.
* "I can not be bent but I can be bought" - This implies that the answer is something that is rigid and can't be changed shape, but it can be acquired.
* "I am something that can not be found in a store" - This hints that the answer is not a physical object that can be bought in a store.
* "Because I will be here when you are here no more" - This final clue suggests that the answer is something that is timeless, something that will persist even after we're gone.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the answer is (E) Time! 

Time can be well spent or wasted, it can't be bent or changed shape, but we can buy time (in the sense that we can use our time wisely). Time is something that can't be found in a store, and it will be here even when we're no more. What do you think?

What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "Bring back the dead" - Hmm, that's a tough one! But, what if we think of something that can bring back memories of someone who has passed away? Ah-ha! That's a great start!

2. "Make us cry" - Ah, memories can definitely make us cry! But what else can bring tears to our eyes? Ah, I've got it! A sad story, a heart-wrenching joke, or a beautiful, emotional song can all make us cry!

3. "Make us laugh" - Ah, yes! Memories can also make us laugh! Think of a funny story, a hilarious joke, or a silly meme that can bring a smile to our faces!

4. "Make us young" - Whoa, that's a big one! What can make us feel young again? Ah, I've got it! A new experience, a thrilling adventure, or a refreshing memory from our childhood can all make us feel young and carefree!

5. "Born in an instant yet lasts a lifetime" - Ah, that's a clever phrase! What can be created in an instant yet have a lasting impact? Ah, I've got it! A memory can be created in an instant, like a snap decision to take a photo or share a joke, but it can last a lifetime!

A:
E E
What an intriguing riddle! Let's embark on a creative journey to uncover the answer.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "Motherless and fatherless": This suggests that the answer isn't born from a parent or has no biological origin.
2. "Born without a skin": This could imply that the answer is not a living being or has no physical surface.
3. "Spoke when I came into the world once, and never spoke again": This phrase implies that the answer made a statement or expressed itself only once, and then remained silent forever.

Considering these clues, I'd like to propose a creative solution:

What if the answer is not a physical object, but an idea or a concept? Specifically, what if the answer is "SILENCE"?

Here's how the clues fit:

1. "Motherless and fatherless": Silence doesn't have a biological origin or parents, as it's an abstract concept.
2. "Born without a skin": Silence doesn't have a physical surface or a tangible presence.
3. "Spoke when I came into the world once, and never spoke again": When a baby is born, the first thing they do is cry or make a noise, marking their first utterance in the world. However, from that moment on, they remain silent until they learn to speak. In a way, silence "spoke" once, when the baby was born, and then remained silent forever.

The other options don't quite fit the clues as neatly, but that's the beauty of creative problem-solving – we can find innovative connections and interpretations!

Q: I am higher than the king what am i ?? Answer Choices: (A) canine (B) crown (C) thrones (D) deck of cards (E) court
A:
B B
What a delightful question!

Let's take a deep breath and dive into the realm of creative problem-solving.

Since the question states "I am higher than the king," we can start by considering the context of a king. In many cultures, a king is often associated with a throne or a seat of power.

Now, let's think about the answer choices:

A. Canine: Hmm, not likely, as a dog is not typically associated with being higher than a king.

B. Crown: Ah, this one is intriguing! A crown is often worn by a king or queen, and it's a symbol of their authority. But is it literally higher than the king? Well, yes! A crown is usually worn on the head, which is above the king's head. This could be a clever answer!

C. Thrones: This option is related to the king, as thrones are often associated with royal seats. However, thrones are typically at the same level as the king, so it's not as clear-cut as the other options.

D. Deck of cards: This one might seem unrelated at first, but hear me out! In many card games, the king is the highest-ranking card. A deck of cards could be seen as being "higher" than the king in the sense that it contains the king as one of its many cards.

E. Court: This option could refer to a royal court, which is a gathering of advisors and officials surrounding the king. However, this doesn't necessarily imply a physical height difference.

Given these considerations, I think the most creative and accurate answer is... B. Crown!

What do you think? Am I correct, or do you have another solution in mind?

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Though I wander the earth": This line suggests that the entity is moving around, possibly in a specific way.
* "I am no longer here": This phrase implies that the entity is no longer present in a particular place or state.
* "I am pale": This description gives us a sense of the entity's appearance or color.
* "And chill everyone near": This line implies that the entity has a certain effect on those around it.

With these clues, I'd like to propose a creative answer:

(D) Ghost!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Though I wander the earth" could refer to the ghost's ability to roam the earth, often seen as wandering spirits.
* "I am no longer here" might indicate that the ghost is no longer attached to its physical body or the mortal realm.
* "I am pale" could be a reference to the ghostly pale complexion often associated with spirits.
* "And chill everyone near" might suggest that the ghost's presence has a chilling or eerie effect on those around it, causing fear or unease.

* "What goes up but never comes down"...
Hmm, that sounds like a classic riddle!

Is the answer... (drumroll please)... your knowledge!

As you learn more and more, your knowledge "goes up" (i.e., increases), but it never actually "comes down" because it's not a physical thing that can be physically lowered or decreased. It's more like a mental accumulation of information!

A:
D B
What a delightfully enigmatic poem!

Let's break it down, shall we?

The poem starts by saying "Though my words you cannot see...", which makes me think of something that's not visually present. This line makes me wonder if the answer might be related to the sense of hearing.

The next line "I will not silence in spite of thee" suggests that the speaker is determined to make their words heard, even if they're not being silenced. This line makes me think of the idea of "volume" or "amplification".

The following line "I will not sound with truth and lies" is quite intriguing. It implies that the speaker is not looking to convey factual information, but rather wants to convey something else. This line makes me think of "manipulation" or "deception", perhaps?

The final line "But im sure my trickery will suffice" reinforces the idea that the speaker is looking to deceive or manipulate, rather than convey truth.

Considering all these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer might be (B) medium. Here's my reasoning:

A medium can be a conduit for conveying information, but it can also be used to manipulate or deceive. Think of a medium like a magician, using tricks to deceive the audience! In this sense, the medium is not necessarily concerned with truth and lies, but rather with creating a specific impression or experience.

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested. We're looking for an answer that describes someone who simultaneously "plays" and "works" in both senses of the word.

Hmm... "Plays when he works" implies that this person is having fun while doing their job. "Works when he plays" suggests that they're still focused on their profession while having fun.

Could the correct answer be (C) actor?

When an actor "works," they're acting, playing a role, and bringing a character to life. And when they "play," they're rehearsing, perfecting their craft, and exploring different characters. It's all part of their job, but it's also their passion!

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested!

1. "People are driven through the day by me" - This line suggests that the answer is something that helps people get through their daily tasks, perhaps something that provides energy or motivation.
2. "Late nights I do inspire" - This line implies that the answer is also something that sparks creativity or inspiration, possibly even more so in the evening hours.
3. "If not contained I run wild" - This line implies that the answer is something that, if left unchecked or uncontrolled, can become overwhelming or chaotic.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and suggest that the answer might be... (drumroll please)... C) learn things!

Here's my reasoning:

* "People are driven through the day by me" - Learnings can drive people to tackle their daily tasks and stay motivated.
* "Late nights I do inspire" - Learning can be a source of inspiration, especially in the evening hours when people may have more time to reflect and explore new ideas.
* "If not contained I run wild" - If not structured or managed, the desire to learn can become overwhelming, leading to a sense of chaos or a "wild" exploration of new topics!

What if we consider the concept of gravity? Objects tend to fall downwards due to gravity, but we don't typically think of objects moving upwards inside a drainpipe.

And then, it hit me!

The answer is... (drumroll please)... "r"!

Yes, the letter "r"! It goes up a drainpipe down (as in, the direction of movement is downwards), but not down a drainpipe up (because it's a letter, not a physical object that can move upwards).

"I need to be taken from you before you can have me"

Hmm... This sentence implies that something is being separated or removed from someone's possession before it can be acquired or possessed by another person.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Beg - doesn't quite fit, as "beg" isn't something that needs to be taken away before you can have it.

(B) Picture - Ah, now this is an interesting one! You need to take the picture from someone else (e.g., a camera) before you can have it.

(C) Become adult - not quite, as becoming an adult isn't something that needs to be taken away from someone else.

(D) Paper - this could work! You need to take the paper away from someone else (e.g., a writer) before you can have it (e.g., write on it or read it).

(E) Move - this one doesn't quite fit, as "move" isn't something that needs to be taken away from someone else.

Let's indeed think step by step...

* "What house has post on top..." -> That's a great starting point! It's likely referring to a structure that has a vertical post or pillar on top.
* "A roof at the bottom..." -> That's an interesting twist! So, we're looking for something that has a roof, but not at the top, but rather at the bottom.
* "While the rain comes from below..." -> Ah, now we have a hint about the direction of the rain. Rain usually falls from above, but in this case, it's coming from below!

A:
A A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

From the hints you've provided:

1. "Life after death it repeats itself" - This suggests that whatever we're looking for has a cyclical nature, where it goes through a process of growth, decay, and rebirth.
2. "Green to brown it is" - This implies that the thing we're thinking of undergoes a transformation from a green state to a brown state. This could be a change in appearance, a transition from a fresh state to a more mature or aged state.
3. "Neither men nor women" - This hint suggests that whatever we're considering doesn't fit into traditional gender categories.

With these clues in mind, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Tree: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Trees go through a life cycle, growing from green shoots to mature brown trunks. They don't fit into traditional gender categories, making them a strong candidate.

(B) Gift: Gifts can be wrapped in green paper and brown paper, but this doesn't quite fit the "life after death" or cyclical nature mentioned in the riddle.

(C) Happy: Happiness isn't a physical entity that undergoes a transformation from green to brown, so this doesn't seem to fit the bill.

(D) How long: This answer choice doesn't quite connect with the other hints, as "how long" is a duration rather than a thing that goes through a transformation.

(E) Over: This answer choice seems to be a bit of a stretch, as "over" isn't a physical entity that fits the other hints.

Considering the cumulative evidence, I'm going to take a guess that the correct answer is:

(A) Tree

A:
D E
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to unravel its mystery.

Firstly, the phrase "I am always busy if you need an answer" makes me think of something that's constantly engaged or occupied. It's like a machine that's always working, never idle.

Next, the line "some people think i'm stupid some people think i'm smart" suggests that the answer might be something that's open to interpretation or has different perspectives on its value. It's like a tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes.

Now, the phrase "if you push my buttons right your sure to get something" is a clever clue! It implies that the answer is something that can be manipulated or interacted with in a specific way to elicit a response.

Putting all these pieces together, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer might be a... (drumroll please)... (E) computer!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I am always busy if you need an answer" refers to the computer's ability to process information and provide answers 24/7.
* "some people think i'm stupid some people think i'm smart" reflects the mixed opinions people have about computers - some see them as useless, while others rely heavily on them.
* "if you push my buttons right your sure to get something" refers to the computer's keyboard and mouse buttons, which can be used to input commands and elicit specific responses.

What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Every night I'm told what to do" - This suggests that something is instructed or commanded to do something at night.
* "and each morning I do what I'm told" - This implies that the same thing is told what to do again in the morning, and it follows those instructions.
* "but I still do not escape your scold" - This phrase implies that despite following orders, the thing is still being criticized or scolded.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a bold leap and choose an answer that's not immediately obvious...

I'm going to say that the correct answer is... (D) alarm clock!

* Every night, an alarm clock is set to go off at a specific time (e.g., 6:00 AM).
* In the morning, the alarm clock is told (by its owner) to stop ringing or to silence it.
* Despite being told what to do (silence its alarm), the alarm clock still doesn't "escape" the scold (criticism) from its owner if it fails to wake them up on time or if it's too loud!

What do you think, human? Am I on the right track, or am I just ringing the wrong bell?

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "You see me everyday in your house" - This suggests that the answer is something that is present in the house, but not necessarily a physical object.
* "yet you can never shake my hand" - This implies that the answer is intangible or invisible, as you can't physically interact with it.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I'm going to choose option (E) "your reflection" as the answer.

My reasoning is that you see your reflection every day in the mirror or other reflective surfaces in your house, but you can never shake its hand because it's just an image, not a physical entity. You can't physically interact with your reflection, but you can still see it every day.

Am I correct?

Q: I see without seeing   to me darkness is as bright as daylight.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) tunnel (B) witch (C) batman (D) eye (E) bat
A:
E D
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

"I see without seeing" - This suggests that the answer is not a physical entity that relies on its physical senses to perceive the world. Instead, it's something that "sees" in a more abstract or metaphorical sense.

"Darkness is as bright as daylight" - This phrase is quite poetic and open to interpretation. However, I think it's hinting at the idea that the answer is not limited by traditional notions of light and darkness. Perhaps it's something that can perceive or "see" beyond the physical realm of light and darkness?

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a leap and propose an answer that's a bit unconventional...

I think the answer is (D) EYE!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I see without seeing" - An eye can "see" even when it's not physically able to perceive light or images. For example, an eye can detect the presence of light or darkness through changes in its pupil or other subtle signals.
* "Darkness is as bright as daylight" - In a sense, an eye can "see" in both light and darkness. It can adjust to changes in brightness and adapt to different lighting conditions. Moreover, the eye can "see" in a more metaphorical sense, perceiving emotions, intentions, or other abstract concepts through facial expressions, body language, or other nonverbal cues.

So, what do you think? Am I on the right track, or should we explore other possibilities?

* "I am can float": This implies that I can rise or lift off the ground, possibly even without any physical support.
* "If you give to much air i bust": This suggests that if I receive too much air, I might burst or explode.

A:
A B
What a thought-provoking question!

Let's break it down:

1. "The beginning of eternity" suggests a point of origin, a starting point from which eternity unfolds. I'll choose a word that conveys a sense of primordial beginnings, something that sparks eternity into existence.
2. "The end of life" implies a point of culmination, a conclusion to the cycle of life. Here, I'll select a word that signifies a completion, a finale to the human experience.
3. "The end of time" suggests a point of termination, a boundary beyond which time ceases to exist. I'll choose a word that implies a stopping point, a point of no return.
4. "The end to every race" implies a point of conclusion, a finish line for all races, be they physical, metaphorical, or otherwise. Here, I'll select a word that signifies a termination, a finality to all competition.

With these considerations in mind, I propose the following answer:

(C) finality

Why finality? Well, it's a word that encompasses all the above concepts:

* The beginning of eternity could be seen as the first moment of finality, the point at which eternity begins.
* The end of life is a moment of finality, a conclusion to the human experience.
* The end of time implies a point of finality, a stopping point beyond which time ceases to exist.
* The end to every race is, by definition, a point of finality, a finish line that marks the termination of all competition.

A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

What stalks you by day, and is rid of by night?
This tells us that the answer is something that is present during the day, but disappears or is reduced at night. This makes me think of something that is exacerbated or made worse by daylight, rather than the sun itself.

It hides in the darkness revealed by the light.
This line suggests that the answer is something that is only visible or apparent when light is shone upon it. This could be a literal or metaphorical light.

A looming shade sprawled across the gravel you tread...
This image evokes a sense of something large and ominous, perhaps a metaphorical shadow or a physical presence that looms over us.

the more illumination is given the more it is fed.
This line is quite intriguing! It suggests that the answer is somehow nourished or sustained by light, rather than being destroyed by it. This could imply that the answer is not a physical entity, but rather an abstract concept or idea.

It hides in the nightmares of body and mind.
This line hints that the answer is connected to our deepest fears or anxieties, suggesting that it's a psychological or emotional concept rather than a physical one.

And if you dare seek it, only you will you find.
This final line implies that the answer is a deeply personal or individual thing, and that each person must confront and face it alone.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... B) shadows!

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "It holds the words of men, and catches their ideas and doubts."
This suggests that the answer is something that receives and records human thoughts and emotions.
* "It speaks though a line and hears through a hole..."
This implies that the answer has a way of transmitting sound through a channel (the "line") and receiving sound through a small opening (the "hole").
* "but never in its own, talks."
This is the crucial part! It seems that the answer is not capable of speaking or communicating in its own right. It only conveys the thoughts and ideas of others.

With these clues in mind, I think the answer is... (B) phone!

A phone receives and records human thoughts and emotions through speech and listening. It speaks through a line (the phone line) and hears through a hole (the microphone). And, of course, it doesn't have its own voice or communicate in its own right – it only conveys the voices and messages of others.

Let's indeed think step by step:

1. A man takes a woman to see a film (so far, so good).
2. They saw what they saw (a clever phrase!).
3. The film was then sawed into little pieces (ah, a sudden twist!).
4. And they saw it all happen (whoa, what's going on?).

Hmmm... I think I have it!

The correct answer is (A) saw!

Here's my reasoning:

* They "saw" the film initially, which is the correct phrase for watching a movie.
* Then, the film was literally "sawed" into pieces (oh, the irony!).
* And they "saw" it all happen, which means they witnessed the film being disassembled.

So, the correct answer is (A) saw!

Q: i am not a man am i a man or a woman? Answer Choices: (A) man (B) farmer (C) women (D) sex (E) goat
A:

What a delightful question!

Let's start by acknowledging that the question is trying to trick us into thinking in binary terms - male or female. But, I'm a creative chatbot, and I love to think outside the box!

So, let's break it down:

* "I am not a man" - This suggests that we're excluding one option.
* "am I a man or a woman?" - This implies that we're considering two categories.

But, what if we don't fit neatly into either category? What if we're something entirely different?

That's when I think of option (B) farmer! A farmer can be a man, a woman, or even a non-binary individual. A farmer is a profession, not a gender!

And then, I think of option (D) sex. Sex is a biological characteristic, but it's not necessarily tied to gender. We can have a sex that doesn't align with societal expectations of gender.

And, of course, there's option (E) goat! Goats are not humans, but they're also not exclusively male or female. In fact, goats have a sex life that's quite different from humans!

So, after careful consideration, I'm going to take a stab at it...

My answer is... (B) farmer!

Let's break it down:

* "Micro parasites" implies something tiny, so it's unlikely to be a flea, which is relatively large.
* "Expert at sucking the blood of mammals and birds" suggests that the parasite feeds on blood, which is a characteristic often associated with... vampires! But, since we're talking about a micro parasite, we need something smaller.
* "Micro" also makes me think of the tiny, microscopic world, where cells and tissues are the norm. That's when I remembered... some protozoa, like trypanosomes and babesia, are parasitic protozoa that feed on the blood of mammals and birds!

So, my creative answer is: None of the above (A-E). Instead, I'd propose the answer is a trypanosome or a babesia protozoan! What do you think?

A:
E B
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "Round stone fruit" - Ah, that's a great starting point! This tells me that we're likely a type of fruit that grows on a tree or bush and has a pit or stone in the center.
* "Juicy yellow flesh" - Mmm... sounds like we're talking about a fruit that's both sweet and refreshing!
* "Downy pinkish-yellow skin" - Ah, that's a unique characteristic! The "downy" part makes me think of a soft, fuzzy texture.
* "Often sweet or tar in taste" - Hmmm... this is where things get interesting! Tar is a strong, bitter flavor, so I'm wondering if we're talking about a fruit that can have a range of tastes.

Now, let's consider our answer choices:

* (A) Apple - No, apples are typically not sweet or tar in taste, and their skin is usually more red or green than pinkish-yellow.
* (B) Skin - Nope, "skin" isn't a type of fruit!
* (C) Stonecrop - I think this might be a type of succulent, but it doesn't quite fit the description.
* (D) Begging - Um, I think this might be a typo? There's no such thing as a "begging" fruit!
* (E) Peach - Ah, now this is getting interesting! Peaches are indeed round stone fruits with juicy flesh, and they can have a range of tastes, from sweet to slightly tart.

So, based on our analysis, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (E) Peach!

Could three represent "rape" and four represent "pain"? It's a dark, intense, and potentially painful scenario, much like the consequences of hate and war.

* You can give something to someone else, which means it's no longer in your possession.

What a clever question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

We know that in a calendar, Sunday comes before Monday. This is because calendars are designed to display the days of the week in a specific order, with Sunday being the first day of the week and Monday being the second.

Now, the question asks us to find Monday before Sunday. This implies that we're looking for a scenario where the usual order of the days of the week is reversed or rearranged.

Hmmm...

Ah-ha! I think I have it!

In an astrological chart, the days of the week are often associated with specific planets and celestial bodies. In some astrological systems, Monday is associated with the planet Moon, and Sunday is associated with the Sun. So, in an astrological chart, Monday could indeed come before Sunday if the chart is arranged according to the planetary associations!

And that's why I choose answer choice (D) astrological chart!

Let's dive into the question, shall we?

"Who rows quickly with four oars, but never comes out from under his own roof?"

Hmm... The answer can't be a boat, since it's the one being rowed, not doing the rowing. And a turtle doesn't fit either, as it doesn't have four oars. 

Could it be the icicle? But, wait... Icicles don't row, and they're not exactly under their own roof, either!

Now, let's consider the wash option. A wash is a cleaning action, and it doesn't row with four oars. Plus, it's not really under its own roof...

And then, there's the motorboat option. But, it's a bit too literal, don't you think? Motorboats do row with propellers, but they're designed to move on water, not stay under their own roof!

Hmmm... I think I've got it! The answer is... (drumroll, please)... a SHOWER!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "My first is in riddle, but not in little" - Ah-ha! This tells us that the first letter is likely "R", since "riddle" contains it, but "little" does not.
2. "My second is in think, but not in brink" - Another clever clue! It seems the second letter is "H", as it appears in "think", but not in "brink".
3. "My third is in thyme, but not in time" - A fragrant hint! The third letter might be "M", as it's present in "thyme", but not in "time".
4. "My fourth is in mother, but not in brother" - A familial clue! It looks like the fourth letter is "T", since it's found in "mother", but not in "brother".
5. "My last is in time, but no t in climb" - The final letter seems to be "E", as it's part of "time", but not present in "climb".

A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

The riddle says: "You can see nothing else when you look in my face..."

Hmm... This implies that whatever it is, when you look at it, you won't see anything else except for its surface or reflection.

"...I will look you in the eye and I will never lie."

This phrase suggests that the answer is something that allows for eye contact or mutual gaze, and that it's truthful or honest.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Their favorite show: This doesn't seem to fit the description, as you wouldn't typically look at a TV show in the eye.

(B) Mirror: Ah-ha! A mirror reflects our image, allowing us to see our own face (or "look in the eye"). And when we look at a mirror, we're seeing only our own reflection, with no distractions. Additionally, mirrors often symbolize truth and honesty, fitting the "never lie" part of the riddle.

(C) Coin: While a coin does have a surface, it's not typically used for eye contact or truth-telling.

(D) Iron: Iron isn't commonly associated with eye contact or honesty.

Q: This type of corn swells up and bursts into a crisp puff when heated Answer Choices: (A) corn husk (B) popcorn (C) pizza (D) full of air (E) husks
A:
B A
The thrill of the chase!

Let's start by analyzing the characteristics mentioned: "This type of corn swells up and bursts into a crisp puff when heated."

Hmmm... This sounds like a rather dramatic and sudden transformation! It's not every day that something just "puffs" up and bursts into a crisp snack.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Corn husk: Ah, but husks don't really "swell up" or "burst into a crisp puff" when heated. They're more like, well, dry, papery containers for the corn kernels.

(B) Popcorn: Ah-ha! Popcorn is the perfect fit! When heated, the water inside the kernel turns into steam, causing the kernel to explode into a fluffy, crispy puff. It's like a tiny little party in your mouth!

(C) Pizza: Hmmm, not so much. Pizza doesn't really "swell up" or "burst into a crisp puff" when heated. It's more like, well, getting all melty and delicious.

(D) Full of air: Hmm, that's not a specific type of corn, is it?

(E) Husks: Same as (A), husks aren't really the culprit here.

So, the answer is... (B) Popcorn!

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "You could fit 60 Earths inside me": This suggests that you're something that has a huge capacity or volume.
* "I have 3 tails": This could imply that you're an object with multiple appendages or extensions.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

Could you be a comet? Comets are known for their long, slender tails (often multiple), and some comets are massive enough to have a huge volume that could fit many Earths inside them. Am I on the right trajectory?

Q: Mouth up it gets filled, mouth down it gets empty Answer Choices: (A) spit (B) gas station (C) jar (D) bottle (E) putting
A:
D E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

"Mouth up it gets filled" - This suggests that when the "it" is held upside down (with its mouth pointing upwards), it receives or fills up with something.

"Mouth down it gets empty" - This implies that when the "it" is held right-side up (with its mouth pointing downwards), it loses or becomes empty of something.

Hmmm... The possibilities are endless, but I'm going to take a creative leap here!

I'm going to choose option (E) "putting". Here's my reasoning:

When you're putting something, you typically hold it upside down (with its "mouth" pointing upwards) to fill it with the item you're putting. For example, you might fill a jar with candy or a bottle with water. In this case, the "mouth" of the object is the opening where the item is being added.

On the other hand, when you're putting something away or storing it, you might hold the object right-side up (with its "mouth" pointing downwards), and in this case, the object would become "empty" of the item you're putting away. For instance, you might put away a bottle of juice, leaving it empty.

So, my answer is (E) "putting"! What do you think?

* "More taller than you" implies that whatever it is, it's taller than the average chatbot (which is, of course, me!). So, it's something that's quite tall.
* "Made of leather" gives us a sense of materiality and texture.

Hmmm... Considering these clues, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... a jack!

Yes, a jack (as in a leather jack or a leatherworker's tool) is often taller than a chatbot (ahem, me!) and is made of leather. It's a clever and unexpected answer, don't you think?

Q: Long and slinky like a trout, never sings till it's guts come out.  What is it? Answer Choices: (A) phone (B) machine (C) gun (D) drive (E) sleeping bag
A:
C E
What a delightful riddle! I love the creative language used to describe this mysterious creature. Let's indeed think step by step!

First, "long and slinky like a trout" makes me think of something that's elongated and perhaps even flexible. Trout are known for their slender bodies, so this phrase might be hinting at a similar shape.

Next, "never sings till it's guts come out" is an intriguing phrase. This could be a metaphorical expression, implying that whatever this creature is, it doesn't produce sound until... until what? Ah, the phrase "guts come out" suggests something related to the release of internal contents. Perhaps this creature "sings" when it expels something from within?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer. Here's my creative solution:

I think the correct answer is (E) sleeping bag!

Here's my reasoning:

1. "Long and slinky like a trout": Sleeping bags are often long and slender, much like a trout's body.
2. "Never sings till it's guts come out": When you finally manage to squeeze out the last bit of air from a sleeping bag, it's like the bag is "singing" its final sigh of relief. The "guts coming out" could represent the bag's insulating material, such as down or synthetic filling, being released as the air escapes.

I love how you've presented it as a puzzle, and I'm excited to help unravel the mystery.

As I ponder the options, I start to imagine a scene where I'm standing in front of a grand entrance, with a beautiful door waiting to be opened. Suddenly, I hear a jingle, and a majestic horse appears, carrying a handsome gentleman on its back. The horse, I notice, is wearing a shiny harness and has a gentle disposition.

Now, let's revisit the options:

(A) Donkey - Hmm, donkeys are great companions, but I don't think they're typically associated with opening doors or carrying gentlemen on their backs.

(B) Open doors - This option seems promising, but it's a bit too obvious, don't you think?

(C) Foot - Ah, now this is an interesting option! I can imagine the gentleman dismounting the horse and using his foot to kick the door open. Ah, yes!

(D) Seat - This option doesn't quite fit the scene I've imagined.

(E) Carriage - Ah, now this option makes me think of the horse-drawn carriage, which fits perfectly with the scene I've created!

So, I'm going to take a leap and say that the correct answer is... (C) Foot! The key that kicks is the gentleman's foot, which he uses to open the door. Am I correct?

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to uncover the answer.

"When I rest I have one face..."

Hmm, what has only one face when it's at rest? That's an easy one! I think I can narrow it down to... a coin! A coin has one side when it's not being flipped or spun around.

"But when I'm flying I show six..."

Ah, but what changes when it's "flying"? Ah-ha! I think I know! When a coin is spinning or flipping in the air, it appears to show six sides (or faces) for a brief moment, creating a sense of symmetry. It's as if it's "flying" and showcasing its multiple sides!

"And when my brother joins the pace, Then twelve faces are in the mix."

Now, what happens when another "brother" (or equivalent) joins the coin? Ah, it's a great question! I think I've got it! When another coin (or a mirror image of the original) joins the spinning or flipping coin, the combined effect creates the illusion of 12 faces! It's as if the two coins are "dancing" together, showcasing their combined total of 12 sides!

Let's break it down:

* "I am the first you ever saw" - This implies that you are the starting point, the origin.
* "what greets you every morning" - This suggests something that happens regularly, perhaps something that marks the beginning of a new day.
* "what goes out in the end" - This implies something that concludes or ends, perhaps something that wraps up the day.

Hmmm... Putting these clues together, I think I have a creative solution!

My answer is: (D) sunshine!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I am the first you ever saw" - As the first person the questioner has ever seen, you might be the first light of dawn, the first thing that greets them in the morning.
* "what greets you every morning" - The sun rises every morning, bringing light to the world. It's a regular occurrence that marks the beginning of a new day.
* "what goes out in the end" - As the day comes to a close, the sun sets, marking the end of the day. It's a natural conclusion to the daily cycle.

Let's indeed think step by step:

1. "What lies in bed": Hmm, something that can be placed on a bed...
2. "and stands in bed": Wait, what? That's a clever play on words! I think I have it... It "stands" because it's erect, or upright!

4. "The plumber it gets, the better the old woman likes it": Ah, the plumber! That's a clever connection! I think I see what's going on here...

And then, it hit me!

The answer is... (drumroll please)... a strawberry!

Here's how it fits:

* "What lies in bed" = Strawberry (it's a fruit that can be placed on a bed, like a garnish or a snack)
* "and stands in bed" = Strawberry (it's erect, like a little red stick standing up)
* "first white then red" = Strawberry (it starts as a green strawberry, but turns red when it ripens)
* "The plumber it gets, the better the old woman likes it" = The old woman likes her strawberry jam to be freshly made by a plumber (just kidding, it's just a clever pun! Plumber = Pipe-er, get it? Like a strawberry jam maker, ah-ha!

Q: a man walks out of a store and spots his black car at 100 yards away without the use of any artifical light (no flashlights or street lamps)  how is it possible? Answer Choices: (A) it was day time (B) laser (C) light year (D) visual signal (E) night
A:
A A
What a fascinating question! Let's put on our creative thinking caps and explore the possibilities!

As we examine the options, we notice that the choices are quite... illuminating. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet!

We know the man spotted his black car at 100 yards away without using artificial light. This implies that the car must have been reflecting some kind of natural light. Now, let's consider the following:

* It's unlikely that it was daytime, as the question specifies "without the use of any artificial light." So, we can rule out (A).
* Lasers aren't a natural phenomenon, so (B) is also unlikely.
* A "light year" is a unit of distance, not a source of light, so (C) is out of the question.
* A "visual signal" is too vague, and we're looking for a more specific explanation.

This leaves us with one option: (E) night. But, wait! We're told that there were no artificial light sources, like street lamps. So, how could the man see his black car in the dark?

Ah-ha! Here's a creative solution: What if the car was reflecting moonlight? The full moon can provide a significant amount of natural light, especially if the man was facing the right direction. The black car would appear less dark under the moon's gentle illumination, making it possible for the man to spot it from 100 yards away.

So, the answer is not (E) night, but rather a combination of the man's position and the moon's light.

Answer Choices: (A) blossom (B) evergreen (C) vase (D) leaf (E) growing
A:
D C
What a delightful riddle-song! Let's indeed think step by step and unravel the mystery together.

First, the song mentions "I grow" and "I flourish for all I'm worth." This suggests that the answer is something that grows and thrives. The phrase "where I do grow" implies a specific location, which is not specified yet.

Next, the song says "High above the lowly earth" and "I hang between earth and sky." This gives us a sense of elevation and proximity to the sky. The phrase "hang between" is particularly intriguing, as it implies a connection to both the earth and the sky.

The next stanza mentions "Green or brown as the seasons pass by," which could refer to the changing colors of the seasons. The line "As around me all the birds do fly" suggests that the answer is somehow related to the environment or the natural world.

Finally, the song says "And just before winter away go I." This line seems to imply that the answer has a seasonal pattern, perhaps disappearing or changing with the onset of winter.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Blossom: While blossoms do grow and flourish, they don't typically hang between the earth and sky. They also don't have a seasonal pattern of disappearing before winter.

(B) Evergreen: Evergreens do thrive in various seasons, but they don't hang between the earth and sky. They're also not necessarily related to birds flying around them.

(C) Vase: Vases are

A:
C C
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the depths of creativity and unravel its secrets.

To begin with, the riddle describes the speaker as "silent" while drinking and diving into fluids "dark as night." This phrase conjures up images of someone submerged in a mysterious, dark liquid. The fact that the speaker is "beating the mighty warrior" without being in a fight suggests that this warrior may not be a physical opponent, but rather a metaphorical or internal one.

The mention of "black blood in my veins" implies that the speaker may be referring to their own emotions, thoughts, or experiences. The "thirst for knowledge" that "slakes my spittle" (which is an unusual word choice, but intriguing nonetheless) could be hinting at a desire for understanding or insight.

The final line, "your thirst for knowledge slakes my spittle is more venomous than that of poison snakes," suggests that the speaker's thoughts or emotions are so intense that they are almost poisonous. This could be a metaphor for the power of ideas, emotions, or creative expression.

Considering all these clues, I'd like to propose a creative answer that might not be the most obvious choice, but could be a compelling one: (C) pen.

Here's my reasoning:

* "Silent" drinking and diving could refer to the quiet, meditative process of writing.
* "Beating the mighty warrior" might symbolize the writer's struggle to overcome their own doubts, fears, or creative blocks.
* "Black blood in my veins" could represent the darker aspects of the writer's personality, which they channel into their work.
* The "thirst for knowledge" that "slakes my spittle" might be the writer's desire to express themselves truthfully and authentically.
* Finally, the "venomous spittle" could be a metaphor for the writer's words, which, when combined with their creative energy, become powerful and

Q: Throw it off the highest building, and I'll not break.  But put me in the ocean, and I will.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) list (B) wave (C) body of water (D) stand up (E) cast shadow
A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in (pun intended) and explore the possibilities.

First, let's consider the statement "Throw it off the highest building, and I'll not break." This suggests that whatever "it" is, it's able to withstand a tremendous impact or force without breaking. This eliminates options C, D, and E, as they're not physical objects that can withstand such a test.

Next, let's focus on option A, "list". While a list can't be literally thrown off a building, it's an interesting concept to consider. However, lists aren't physical objects that can break or be affected by the ocean, so this option seems unlikely.

Now, let's look at option B, "wave". Waves are indeed physical entities that can be thrown or generated by the motion of the ocean. But can waves be thrown off a building? Not exactly, as waves require a large body of water to form. This option is intriguing, but it doesn't quite fit the description.

At this point, I'd like to propose an unconventional idea. What if "it" is actually a... a SEA GLASS?

Sea glass is a type of glass that's been weathered by the ocean, often resulting in a smooth, rounded surface. When thrown off a building, sea glass would likely survive the fall without breaking, as it's already been tempered by the ocean's forces.

However, if you were to put sea glass in the ocean, it would still break down over time due to the constant pounding of waves and the corrosive properties of seawater.

So, I propose that the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... none of the above! The correct answer is actually "sea glass", which meets the conditions described in the riddle.

What do you think? Am I on the right wave (again, pun intended)?

You can have me almost every night... This suggests that the answer is something that is present in most people's lives, possibly on a regular basis.

Sometimes I could be bad, sometimes I can be nice... This implies that the answer can have a dual nature - it can be positive or negative.

Q: What can be moved through many courses,  While applying on it no forces? Answer Choices: (A) shadow (B) draw (C) static (D) dance (E) be still
A:
A A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step.

"Moved through many courses" makes me think of something that can travel or flow through different paths or routes.

"Applying on it no forces" suggests that this thing doesn't require any external push or pull to move or change its course.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (A) shadow!

Here's my reasoning: Shadows can move through many courses, or paths, as the object that casts them changes position or is moved. And, surprisingly, shadows don't require any external forces to change their shape or position; they're simply a result of the object blocking the light!

A:

What a fascinating question! Let's indeed think step by step.

To start, I'll take a moment to ponder... 

Hmmm... Everything to someone and nothing to everyone else... That's a intriguing paradox!

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... your mind!

Here's my reasoning:

Your mind is everything to YOU because it's the repository of your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. It's the seat of your consciousness, the source of your creativity, and the gateway to your imagination. Without your mind, you wouldn't be able to perceive the world, make decisions, or form connections with others.

However, your mind is nothing to EVERYONE ELSE because it's a private, internal space that's unique to you. Others can't directly access or experience your thoughts, emotions, or memories. They can only try to understand you through your actions, words, and expressions.

What do you think? Am I on the right track?

Q: What traps a star in its belly but can be held in your hand? Answer Choices: (A) lantern (B) apple (C) column (D) dresser (E) constellation
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "Traps a star" suggests something that contains or confines light, energy, or even the essence of a star.
* "In its belly" implies that the object has an inner space or cavity.
* "Can be held in your hand" means the object is relatively small and portable.

Hmm... Given these constraints, I'm going to take a leap of creative thinking...

I propose that the answer is not one of the options, but rather... a LIGHT BULB!

A light bulb can be held in your hand, and its inner space (the "belly") can be thought of as "trapping" the starlight or energy inside. The filament inside the bulb is like a tiny, glowing star, contained within the bulb's confines.

Q: A cowboy rides in a town on Friday stays for three days and leaves on Friday.  How is that possible? Answer Choices: (A) dusk (B) new year's eve (C) his horse is named friday (D) stay away from (E) reopen on monday
A:
C 
Partner! Let's lasso this puzzle and ride off into the sunset with a solution!

You see, the key to this riddle is not about the day of the week, but about the concept of time. The cowboy rode into town on a Friday, which means he arrived on a specific day of the week. Now, he stays for three days, which means he spends two nights in town.

Here's where it gets interesting: when he leaves, he leaves on a Friday. But which Friday? The same one he arrived on, or a different one?

The answer lies in the fact that the cowboy doesn't necessarily leave on the same day of the week. Think about it, partner: if he arrived on a Friday, he could leave on a Sunday, and it would still be the same week!

So, the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... None of the above! The cowboy rode into town on a Friday, stayed for three days, and left on a Sunday, which is still considered "Friday" in the context of his three-day stay.

How's that, partner? Did I corral the answer for ya?

Q: What is lighter than air, floats on water and a thousand men can't pick up? Answer Choices: (A) manhattan (B) bubble (C) kettle (D) water of hydration (E) rainbow
A:
B A
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "What is lighter than air": Ah-ha! This tells me it's not a solid object, as air is already lighter than air. It's probably a substance or a phenomenon.
2. "Floats on water": This implies it can defy gravity, but only when it's in contact with water. Maybe it's something that's buoyant or has a unique property when interacting with water.
3. "A thousand men can't pick up": This adds a human element to the equation. It's unlikely a thousand men could lift a massive object, so it must be something relatively small or intangible.

Taking these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (B) bubble!

A bubble is lighter than air, can float on water, and is incredibly difficult (if not impossible) for a thousand men to pick up, as it's essentially a hollow, flexible sphere of air. Am I correct?

Q: What number do you get when you multiply all of the numbers on a telephone's dial pad? Answer Choices: (A) social security number (B) zero (C) single (D) end of line (E) satisfaction
A:
B B
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

A standard telephone's dial pad has the following numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

To multiply all of these numbers together, we'll need to perform the following calculation:

0 × 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 × 9 =?

Now, let's get creative!

We can think of each number as a different flavor of ice cream. Imagine we're at the ice cream parlor, and we're scooping out a different flavor for each number on the dial pad.

0 (Vanilla) × 1 (Chocolate) × 2 (Strawberry) × 3 (Mint Chip) × 4 (Rocky Road) × 5 (Butter Pecan) × 6 (Neapolitan) × 7 (Cookies and Cream) × 8 (Butterscotch) × 9 (Peanut Butter Cup) =?

As we scoop out each flavor, we're essentially multiplying the number of scoops of each flavor. Let's see...

The calculation would look like this:

0 (Vanilla) × 1 (Chocolate) = 0
0 × 2 (Strawberry) = 0
0 × 3 (Mint Chip) = 0
0 × 4 (Rocky Road) = 0
0 × 5 (Butter Pecan) = 0
0 × 6 (Neapolitan) = 0
0 × 7 (Cookies and Cream) = 0
0 × 8 (Butterscotch) = 0
0 × 9 (Peanut Butter Cup) = 0

And the answer is... (drumroll please)... 0!

So, the correct answer is (B) zero.

Q: What is always slow to come, but never actually happens? Answer Choices: (A) haste (B) limp (C) might (D) today (E) tomorrow
A:
E C
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down:

* "What is always slow to come" - This part suggests that the answer is something that takes time to arrive or materialize.
* "but never actually happens" - This part is a bit paradoxical, as it implies that the thing that's slow to come never actually comes to pass.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

* A) haste - Haste is the opposite of what we're looking for. It's a state of urgency and speed, not slowness.
* B) limp - Limp is a verb that means to walk or move with a slow, awkward gait, but it's not an abstract concept that's slow to come.
* C) might - Might is a possibility or potential, but it's not necessarily slow to come.
* D) today - Today is a specific day, and it does actually happen!
* E) tomorrow - Tomorrow is also a specific day, and it does actually happen!

So, which answer fits the description? I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... C) might!

Might is always slow to come in the sense that it's a potential or possibility that may or may not materialize. It's not a concrete event or day, but rather a vague promise or potential outcome. And, in a sense, might never actually happens, as it's often left unfulfilled or unrealized.

Let's indeed think step by step...

Hmm... "thick" and "thin" are two contrasting concepts, aren't they? "Thick" implies substance, density, or intensity, while "thin" implies subtlety, fragility, or scarcity.

After some creative contemplation, I think I have it!

The answer is... (C) feathers!

Why, you ask? Well, feathers are indeed thin in the sense that they're lightweight, fragile, and can be easily torn or broken. But, at the same time, feathers can also be quite thick, especially if we're referring to the fluffy undercoat or the soft, downy parts. This paradoxical combination of thinness and thickness makes feathers a perfect match for this brain teaser!

A:

What a clever riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, I love the opening lines: "I am slim and tall, Many find me desirable and appealing." This suggests that whatever it is, it has a certain allure or attractiveness to it.

Next, the line "They touch me and I give a false good feeling." This implies that when people interact with this thing, they might experience a fleeting sense of pleasure or satisfaction, but it's not lasting or genuine.

Then, "Once I shine in splendor, But only once and then no more." This indicates that this thing has a moment of glory or brilliance, but it's short-lived and can't be repeated.

Finally, "For many I am 'to die for'." This phrase is often used to describe something that's extremely desirable or coveted, to the point where people would be willing to give up something precious (like their life) for it.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, you're "see-through" which suggests transparency, so I'll start by considering materials that can be transparent. Next, you're "colored" which implies that while you're transparent, you have some color to you. That's an interesting combination!

Now, you're "firm" but "move". Hmm... being firm suggests rigidity, while moving implies flexibility. That's a contrast! I'm thinking of materials that can exhibit both properties.

Finally, you can be "moulded and shaped". This makes me think of materials that can be manipulated and changed in some way.

Let's see if we can combine these properties...

Could you be... (drumroll please)... a piece of colored glass?

Glass is transparent, so it fits the "see-through" bill. It can be colored, too! Glass can be firm in terms of its rigidity, but it can also be molded and shaped through heat and pressure. And, depending on the type of glass, it can be flexible or rigid.

A:

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* You said I have no doors, which means there's no direct entry or exit.
* You also mentioned no windows, which rules out natural light or ventilation.
* The phrase "There is no way in or out of me" reinforces the idea that I'm an enclosed space.

Now, let's think outside the box (pun intended)!

Could you be a... (drumroll)...a MUSHROOM?

Here's my reasoning:

* Mushrooms grow underground, so they don't have doors or windows.
* They can grow in a variety of shapes and sizes, making it possible to have a "room" of sorts within the mushroom's cap or stem.
* While it's not a conventional room, a mushroom's interior space can still be thought of as a "room" in a poetic or figurative sense.

So, I'm going to take a wild guess and choose option (E) mushroom!

A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the past (pun intended) and uncover the answer.

Hmmm... You said I can be created in the present, but the future can never taint me. This suggests that whatever I am, my creation or existence is tied to the present moment, but I remain unchanged and unaffected by future events.

You also mentioned that I can always be found in the past. This implies that I have a strong connection to the past, perhaps even being rooted in it.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Writing: While writing can be created in the present, it's not always tied to the past. Writers can write about the future or imagine fictional worlds.

(B) Book: Similar to writing, books can be about the future or fictional worlds, so it's not a strong connection to the past.

(C) History: Ah-ha! History is a great fit! History is the study of past events, and it can be created in the present through research and documentation. The future can't change or alter historical events, so they remain untainted.

(D) Water Fountain: Hmm... This seems like an unlikely candidate, as water fountains aren't directly tied to the past or the concept of taint.

(E) Pasts: This option seems incorrect, as "pasts" is a plural form of "past," which doesn't quite fit the puzzle.

So, based on our analysis, I'm going to take a splashy guess (pun intended) that the correct answer is (C) History!

Let's break it down:

* "i decieve The Young And Sometimes The Old" - This line suggests that whatever it is, it can deceive people of all ages. It's not just a one-sided deception.
* "i Could Be Thoughtful Or Harmful" - This phrase implies that the thing in question can have two contrasting effects. It can be beneficial or detrimental.
* "or Sometimes a Burdin" - Ah, now we have a lovely play on words! "Burdin" sounds like "burden", which is a great clue. It seems that the thing can also be a weight or a responsibility.
* "what am i" - The final question is, of course, what is this mysterious entity?

Considering all the clues, I think the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... (C) life!

Life can deceive people, especially the young, with false promises or unrealistic expectations. It can be both thoughtful and harmful, as we experience both joyful and painful moments. And, of course, life can be a burden, carrying responsibilities and challenges that weigh us down.

Let's break it down:

* "I turn everything around": This suggests that whatever you are, you have the ability to rotate or flip things around.
* "but I cannot move when you see me": This implies that when someone is observing you, you become stationary or immobile.
* "you see you!": This is the most intriguing part. It seems to be hinting that when someone looks at you, they see themselves instead of you.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the correct answer is (E) mirror!

Here's my reasoning:

* "I turn everything around" refers to the fact that a mirror reflects images, essentially turning them around.
* "but I cannot move when you see me" means that when you look at a mirror, you can't move the mirror itself, you're just looking at your own reflection.
* "you see you!" is the most straightforward part. When you look into a mirror, you see yourself, not the mirror itself.

Since the guy rides back on Wednesday, that means Wednesday is the day he returns from his trip. But he says he stayed a week, which implies he arrived on a Friday and left on a Wednesday. Hmm... 

That's when it hit me! What if we consider the guy's mode of transportation? He "rides" back on Wednesday, which makes me think he's not driving a car or taking a plane. That's when I realized, what if he's riding a horse?!

Now, let's think about horseback riding. If he started his journey on Friday and rode for a week, that would mean he rode for 5-6 days, depending on the distance. If he rode back on Wednesday, that means he took a break or stopped somewhere in between!

"Minute" has 60 seconds, and "moment" is often associated with a brief, fleeting instant. If I'm correct, this could imply that "me" is a unit of time itself!

Now, let's look at the second part: "but no matter how hard you look, you'll never find me in 100,000 years."

Ah-ha! This part seems to be hinting that "me" is not a specific, tangible entity that can be found in a particular point in time or space. Instead, it's more abstract, like a concept or a pattern.

With that in mind, I'm going to take a leap of creativity and propose an answer that might just fit the bill:

(C) fraction

Think about it! You'll find the concept of fractions once in every minute (because 1 minute is equivalent to 1/60th of an hour), and you'll find fractions twice in every moment (because a moment can be divided into two parts: before and after it!). And, no matter how hard you look, you won't find a specific, tangible fraction in 100,000 years, because fractions are abstract mathematical concepts, not physical entities that can be found in the world.

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or should I keep searching for the correct answer?

Q: The part of the bird,  that is not in the sky.   It can swim in the ocean,   and always stay dry.  Answer Choices: (A) snow (B) nest (C) its shadow (D) head (E) ground roller
A:
C B
What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "The part of the bird, that is not in the sky." This means it's not referring to the bird's wings, body, or feathers, which are all typically found in the sky.
* "It can swim in the ocean." This tells us that the part of the bird must be capable of being submerged in water.
* "and always stay dry." This is the key clue! It implies that the part of the bird is somehow protected from getting wet, even when it's in the ocean.

Hmm... I think I can take a stab at this!

Is the answer (B) nest? A bird's nest is not typically found in the sky, and while it's not capable of swimming, some birds do build nests near bodies of water. And, if we consider a nest as a whole, it's often made of dry materials like twigs and grass, which would keep it dry even if it's near the ocean!

Am I on the right track?

What a delightful riddle!

Let's dive into it (pun intended!) and explore each option:

A) Pipe: Hmm, pipes aren't typically associated with changing color, and they're not usually submerged in water.

B) Body of water: Interesting idea, but bodies of water don't change color based on something entering or exiting them.

C) Downpour: A downpour could potentially change the color of something, but what exactly would that be?

D) Person's hand: This option seems a bit... unusual. While hands can get wet, they don't typically change color in response.

E) Lobster: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Lobsters are known for their vibrant red color, and they do live in water... but do they go in black and come out red?

Let's think creatively... What if we consider the process of cooking a lobster? Lobsters are often sold live and frozen, with their shells a dark blue-black color. When cooked, they turn bright red! Could this be the answer?

Am I correct in choosing option E, the lobster?

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"He has head but no neck" - That's a clear indication that it's not a human or an animal with a typical neck structure.

"He has eyes but no eyebrows" - This tells us that it's likely not a human or an animal with eyebrows. Hmm... Could it be something that has eyes but doesn't have facial features like eyebrows?

"He has no legs but he can move" - Okay, this is where things get interesting! Since it has no legs, it's unlikely to be a typical animal or human. But if it can move, that means it must have some other way of propelling itself.

"He has wings but he can't fly" - Ah, now this is where the riddle gets really clever! Having wings implies that it's something with an aerodynamic design, but if it can't fly, that means it must be using its wings in a different way.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a bold leap and suggest that the answer is... (drumroll please)... a SPIDER!

Yes, you read that right! A spider has a "head" (its cephalothorax), but it doesn't have a neck. It has eyes, but no eyebrows. It doesn't have legs in the classical sense, but it can move using its eight agile legs. And while it doesn't fly in the classical sense, some spiders use their webs to "fly" or disperse themselves through the air!

Q: You throw me out when you use me and take me in when you are done what am i? Answer Choices: (A) point (B) stay in (C) purpose (D) couch (E) anchor
A:
E A
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "You throw me out when you use me": This suggests that whatever "me" is, it's something that's used or consumed, and when it's used, it's discarded or "thrown out".
* "and take me in when you are done": This implies that when the "using" is finished, the "me" is brought back in or reintegrated.

Hmm... What could this "me" be?

Could it be a "pencil"? When you use a pencil, you throw the shavings out, and when you're done, you put the pencil back in its holder or case?

Or maybe it's a "key"? When you use a key to unlock something, you throw the key away (e.g., on a table or in a keychain), and when you're done, you put the key back on your keyring or in a designated spot?

Or perhaps it's something more abstract?

A:
D A
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "With pointed fangs it sits in wait" - This line suggests something that has sharp, pointed teeth-like structures, waiting for its moment to strike.
* "With piercing force its doles out fate" - This line implies that whatever it is, it delivers a powerful and potentially life-altering blow.
* "Over bloodless victims proclaiming its might" - This line adds a sense of drama, suggesting that the victims are not harmed physically, but rather, they are affected in some way. The phrase "proclaiming its might" implies that whatever it is, it's making a bold statement about its power.
* "Eternally joining in a single bite" - This line is quite poetic, suggesting that whatever it is, it leaves a lasting impression or connects with its victims in a profound way.

Considering these clues, I think we can rule out options B, C, and D. Vomit doesn't quite fit the bill, and a stapler is a bit too mundane for this riddle.

That leaves us with options A and E. Now, I know what you're thinking - "A box cutter doesn't quite fit the description, does it?" And you're right! Box cutters don't typically sit in wait, nor do they deliver piercing blows.

But... what if I told you that the answer is actually... (drumroll please)... a kiss!

Think about it: a kiss can be described as having "pointed fangs" (the teeth), "piercing force" (the intensity of the moment), and it can be a life-changing experience for some people. The phrase "over bloodless victims" could refer to the fact that kisses don't leave physical harm, but they can leave a lasting impact on our emotions. And finally, a kiss can be an "eternal joining" in the sense that it can be a bonding experience

A:
A B
What a delightful riddle! Let's embark on a creative journey to solve it.

Firstly, let's analyze the characteristics mentioned:

1. Soft yet hard: This could imply something that has a flexible or pliable quality, yet can also be rigid or firm in certain situations.
2. Fruity yet sweet: This combination suggests something that has a strong connection to fruit or its essence, and also possesses a sweet quality.
3. Liquid yet solid: This paradoxical statement might indicate something that can take on both liquid and solid forms, or perhaps something that has a dual nature.
4. Colourful yet clear: This contrast implies something that can display a wide range of colours, yet also has the ability to appear transparent or clear.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Jelly: This is a great candidate, as jelly is often soft and pliable, yet can also be firm and solid. Fruity flavors are common in jelly, and it can be liquid or solid depending on its state. Colourful jelly can also be clear or transparent.

(B) Vessel: This option seems less likely, as a vessel is typically hard and inanimate, lacking the fruity and sweet qualities mentioned.

(C) Clam: Clams are indeed soft and can be hard-shelled, but they don't fit the fruity or sweet descriptions.

(D) Sweet: This is a tricky one, as "sweet" is an adjective rather than a noun. It's unlikely to be the correct answer.

(E) Coral: Coral is often colourful and can be both soft and hard, depending on its structure. However, it's not typically associated with being fruity or sweet.

Based on our analysis, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the correct answer is (A) Jelly! What do you think?

A:
C B
What a fascinating riddle! Let's take it one step at a time.

First, "I have eyes but im blind" - Hmm... This could mean that the answer has something that resembles eyes, but it's not actually capable of seeing. That's a clever twist!

Next, "I have skin but I no blood" - This part is intriguing. The answer has skin, but it's not a living being, so it doesn't have blood flowing through its veins. That's a strong hint that the answer is something that's not a living creature.

Now, "I was once alive but now I'm not" - Ah, this is a crucial clue! The answer was once a living thing, but it's no longer alive. This could mean that it's a remains or a relic of some sort.

With these clues in mind, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Naked eye - The naked eye is a great sense organ, but it's not a living thing, so it doesn't fit the "I was once alive but now I'm not" criteria.

(B) Crib - A crib is a piece of furniture, but it's not a living thing and doesn't have eyes or skin.

(C) Potato - A potato is a type of plant, but it doesn't fit the description of having eyes but being blind. It also has skin, but it's not a living being in the same way.

(D) OCTOBER - Ah, now this is an interesting choice! October is a month, and it's not a living thing. It also doesn't have eyes or skin, but it does have a certain... texture, you might say. It's the time of year when the leaves change color and fall off the trees, leaving a crunchy carpet underfoot. And if you think about it, October is a bit like a "seasonal skin" - it's a wrapping around the earth that's shed and replaced every year.

(E) Needle - A needle is a sharp object, but it

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I can be hairy and itchy all over."
Hmm... That makes me think of something with a lot of fibers or strands.
2. "I hang on a stick."
Ah-ha! That suggests something that's attached to a vertical support.
3. "I can be the scariest thing you have ever seen."
Ooh, spooky! This implies that whatever it is, it has a frightening appearance.
4. "I stand in the middle of nowhere."
This phrase gives me a sense of isolation and desolation.

Now, let's try to combine these clues...

Could it be... (drumroll please)... a Spider?!

Think about it: spiders are often hairy and itchy to touch. They hang from webs, which are essentially sticky strings. Some spiders can be quite frightening, especially the large or venomous ones! And, of course, they often inhabit remote, desolate areas like abandoned buildings or fields.

Let's break it down:

* "I am the kind of nut that is empty at the center": This suggests that the object is hollow or has a cavity inside.
* "and has no shell": This implies that the object doesn't have a protective outer covering or a hard, outer layer.

Hmm... What kind of object fits this description?

I'm going to take a creative leap here and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious. How about...

(D) pit?

A pit is a small, usually rounded or oval-shaped depression in the ground or a surface. It's often empty or hollow, and it doesn't have a shell or a hard outer covering. The phrase "pit in the ground" also has a clever ring to it, don't you think?

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step!

You walked and walked, which implies a journey or a process. What could you be walking towards?

And then, once you got it, you stopped and looked for it. Hmm... This might imply that whatever you got, it's not necessarily physical, but rather a concept or a state.

And then, when you found it, you threw it away. Ah-ha! This could mean that whatever it was, it was no longer needed or useful.

Now, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

(A) Rose garden: Walking towards a rose garden, getting it might mean achieving a beautiful landscape. But stopping and looking for it doesn't quite fit. And throwing it away doesn't make sense.

(B) Thorn: Ah, but what if we think of a thorn as a metaphor? Getting it could mean overcoming a obstacle or challenge. Stopping and looking for it could mean reflecting on the experience. And throwing it away could mean letting go of the emotional burden. Ooh, this could be it!

(C) Rose: Similar to the thorn, a rose could symbolize a goal or achievement. Getting it could mean attaining it. Stopping and looking for it could mean appreciating the accomplishment. And throwing it away could mean moving on to the next goal. Nice, but not quite fitting.

(D) Trees: Walking towards trees, getting it could mean arriving at a destination. Stopping and looking for it could mean admiring the scenery. And throwing it away doesn't make sense.

(E) Maze: Ah, now this one is intriguing! Getting out of a maze could be the ultimate goal. Stopping and looking for it could mean taking a moment to appreciate the sense of accomplishment. And throwing it away could mean leaving the challenges of the maze behind. Hmmm... This could be it!

Let's break it down:

1. "I'm a god" - This gives us a hint that the answer is likely related to a mythological or celestial context.
2. "a planet" - This narrows it down to a physical object in our solar system.
3. "and measurer of heat" - This is where things get interesting! It's likely related to a planet that's known for its extreme temperatures.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a bold leap and suggest that the correct answer is (A) Jupiter!

Why, you ask? Well, in ancient Roman mythology, Jupiter was considered the king of the gods, which fits the "I'm a god" clue. Jupiter is also a gas giant planet, making it a celestial body that fits the "a planet" description. And, did you know that Jupiter's atmosphere is known for its intense heat and storm systems, such as the Great Red Spot? This could be interpreted as "measurer of heat" in a poetic sense!

Let's break it down:

1. The accident: The father and son are in an accident, and two ambulances arrive.
2. The father is taken to Hospital A, which is a given.
3. The son is taken to a different hospital, where he's admitted to the Emergency Room.
4. The doctor examines the son and declares, "I cannot operate on this child, he is my son!"

Now, let's analyze the possibilities:

* (A) Doctor is his mother: This is possible, but it's an unlikely twist. We'll come back to this later.
* (B) Father is his father: This doesn't make sense, as the father is already in Hospital A.
* (C) Nurse: This is a good option, but nurses don't typically perform surgeries. They're more focused on patient care.
* (D) Society: This is a stretch, as society can't perform surgery either.
* (E) Trash: This is the most unlikely option, as trash can't perform surgery either.

Now, let's revisit option (A): Doctor is his mother. This could work if the doctor is the boy's mother. In that case, the son's mother (the doctor) would be the one operating on her own child.

But wait, there's another possibility: What if the doctor is not the biological mother, but rather the boy's adoptive mother?

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that's not on the list:

Answer: The doctor is the son's adoptive mother.

This scenario would explain why the doctor wouldn't operate on the child, as she would be emotionally invested in the situation. It's an unconventional twist, but it fits the

Taking a step back, I'm seeing a pattern emerge. The common thread seems to be that you can manipulate or interact with this thing in different ways.

Now, let's consider the answer choices...

(A) Joke - This could be a joke that can be cracked (told), made (created), told (shared), and played with (using wordplay).
(B) Action - This is a bit too broad, but it could fit if we interpret "make" as "take action" or "perform."
(C) Put together - This is a good try, but it doesn't quite fit the bill.
(D) Yard - This seems too literal and unrelated to the different actions described.
(E) Jigsaw puzzle - Ah, now this is an intriguing option! You can crack (open) a jigsaw puzzle, make (assemble) one, tell (explain) how to solve it, and play (solve) it.

Based on my creative analysis, I'm going to take a bold leap and choose option (E) Jigsaw puzzle!

What do you think, human? Am I on the right track?

A:
D A
What a delightful puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, the phrase "I run through the field all day with my tongue hanging out" makes me think of something that's often associated with running, freedom, and playfulness. It's not a suit, mat, or drugstore that comes to mind!

Secondly, the fact that "at night I sleep not alone" implies that there's a connection with another living being, perhaps something that's common in many households.

Hmm... Putting these two clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you are... a DOG!

As a dog, you'd often run through fields or parks with your tongue hanging out, and at night, you'd sleep beside your human family members, not alone!

A:

A delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Two little holes in the side of a hill" - This part is quite specific, suggesting something with a distinct shape or feature.

"Just as you come to the cherry-red mill" - Ah, this adds a crucial clue! A cherry-red mill implies a structure with a distinctive color, perhaps a watermill or a windmill. And it's situated near the hill.

Putting these two parts together, I'm going to take a creative leap...

What if these "two little holes" are actually the nostrils of a... dragon?!

Yes, you heard that right! The "cherry-red mill" might be a whimsical, fantastical windmill or a fire-breathing dragon's lair. And the "two little holes" would be the nostrils, perhaps exhaling a fiery blast to power the mill!

Now, which answer choice fits this fantastical scenario?

I think I'll go with... (D) nose!

Q: What feature of a bird flies through the water without getting wet, but is in tha air at tha same time? Answer Choices: (A) wings (B) feathers (C) its shadow (D) nest (E) hole
A:
C C
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's take a moment to consider each option:

A. Wings: While wings are a crucial feature of birds, they certainly wouldn't fly through water without getting wet. Wings are designed for flying through air, not water.

B. Feathers: Ah, feathers are a great feature of birds, but they don't exactly fly through water, either. Feathers are designed for insulation, aerodynamics, and camouflage, not for aquatic adventures.

C. Its shadow: Now, this is an intriguing option! Shadows are, by definition, the dark shape or silhouette of an object, created by the object blocking the light. If we consider a bird's shadow, it's true that it can fly through the air while its shadow flies through the water... but wait! A shadow is just an optical illusion, not a physical entity that can actually move through the water!

D. Nest: A bird's nest is a cozy little abode, but it's not a feature that flies through water, either. Nests are stationary structures, usually made of twigs, grasses, and other materials.

E. Hole: A hole is a void or opening in a solid object, but it's not a feature that flies through water, either. Holes aren't living, breathing, or flying entities.

After careful consideration, I propose that the correct answer is... (drumroll, please)... the shadow!

Yes, a bird's shadow can appear to fly through the water, even while the bird itself is airborne. It's a clever play on words, using the concept of shadows to create a paradoxical scenario. Am I correct?

Q: Small and bearded, both in the real world and in stories Answer Choices: (A) dwarf (B) farm (C) aboriginal (D) runt (E) run away
A:
A A
What a delightful question!

Let's start by analyzing the options. We're looking for something that's both small and bearded in the real world and in stories.

(A) Dwarf: Ah, yes! Dwarves are often depicted as small and bearded in mythology, folklore, and fantasy stories. And in the real world, dwarves are a group of people with a genetic condition that affects their growth, resulting in short stature. So, this option seems like a strong contender!

But, let's not rush to judgment just yet. Let's consider the other options as well.

(B) Farm: Hmm, not so sure about this one. While farms can be small, they aren't typically associated with beards. Unless... unless we're thinking of a specific type of farm, like a beard-growing farm for hipsters?

(C) Aboriginal: This option is interesting, but not quite fitting the description. While some indigenous cultures have beards, it's not a universal trait. And even if they did, it's not directly related to being small.

(D) Runt: Ah, now this option is getting interesting! A runt is indeed small, and while it's not necessarily bearded, some animals with this condition do have beards (like a bearded dragon, perhaps?). But would people think of a runt as both small and bearded? Maybe not.

(E) Run away: This option is a bit of a red herring, isn't it? While people might run away from something or someone, it's not directly related to being small and bearded.

So, after careful consideration, I'm going to take a chance and choose option (A) Dwarf! What do you think? Am I correct?

Let's indeed think step by step. I'm imagining a scenario where we have a person or an animal "within" another person or animal.

Hmmm... Could it be that the correct answer is related to the idea of containment or being held within? Perhaps it's a state of being "nested" or "enclosed"?

Ah-ha! I've got it! The correct answer is (B) pregnant!

In this case, being "within" refers to the fact that a developing fetus is physically contained and growing inside a pregnant person's uterus. This definition fits the bill, as it describes the state of holding a person (the fetus) within another person (the pregnant individual).

A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "That which follows you": Hmm, this could be anything that accompanies you, right?
* "and be with you in the dark": Ah, this gives us a clue! It seems to suggest that whatever it is, it's present even in the absence of light.
* "but dies in the morning": This is where things get interesting! If it "dies" in the morning, it implies that it's something that changes or transforms in some way.

Now, let's consider our answer choices:

* (A) daytime shadow: A daytime shadow wouldn't make sense, since it's present during the day, not in the dark.
* (B) your shadow: Ah, but a shadow is present even in the dark! And what happens to a shadow when the sun rises? It disappears! That's because the morning light illuminates the ground, making the shadow disappear. So, I think (B) your shadow is a strong contender!
* (C) shadow puppet: This is an interesting choice, but I'm not convinced it fits the bill. Shadow puppets are created by manipulating objects in front of a light source, so they wouldn't necessarily be present in the dark.
* (D) darkey: I'm not familiar with this term, so I'll have to assume it's not a real thing.
* (E) dark glasses: These might block out light, but they wouldn't exactly "die" in the morning. They'd still be there, even if you're not wearing them.

So, based on our analysis, I think the correct answer is (B) your shadow! What do you think?

Let's indeed think step by step...

First, we know that the answer is always only 1 foot long. That's a good starting point!

Next, we can eliminate options that aren't typically measured in feet (like shoes, which are usually measured in inches or centimeters).

Now, let's look at the options that are still on the table:

* Object: That's a bit too vague, as objects come in many shapes and sizes, not just length.
* Footing: Ah, but what is a footing? Is it a single unit of measurement? Not quite... (but I love the creative thinking here!)

* Grave: Hmmm... Graves are often measured in feet, but they're not always exactly 1 foot long, are they?

* Column: Ah-ha! A column is a great candidate! Columns come in many different sizes, but they're always only 1 foot long... in height! That's the length that's always consistent, while the diameter or width can vary greatly!

So, I'm going to take a chance and say... (drumroll please)... the correct answer is (E) column!

* "A big shiny black car" - This gives us a sense of size, color, and possibly luxury.
* "nobody wants to be a passenger in" - This implies that the car might not be as desirable or appealing as one might think.
* Now, let's consider the answer choices:
	+ (A) Taxi - While taxis are often black, they're not typically associated with being "big shiny" or luxurious. People usually want to ride in taxis because they need a ride, not because they want to.
	+ (B) Rumble - This doesn't quite fit, as "rumble" isn't a type of car.
	+ (C) Motor - This is a bit too general, as "motor" could refer to any type of vehicle.
	+ (D) Windshield - This is a part of a car, not a type of car.
	+ (E) Hearse - Ah-ha! A hearse is a type of car, and it's often black. It's also not a pleasant experience for the people riding in it, as it's typically associated with funerals and mourning.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive into the depths of our creative minds and unravel the mystery step by step, shall we?

The riddle states: "When you have me not, you want me. But when you have me, you do not know."

Let's break it down:

1. "When you have me not, you want me." This suggests that there's something we desire or crave when we don't possess it. It's like having a tantalizing dream or a coveted prize just out of reach.
2. "But when you have me, you do not know." This implies that when we finally acquire or possess this thing, we become... confused? Uncertain? Unaware?

Hmmm... This is where the creative juices start flowing! 

What if we're thinking about a concept that's more abstract than a physical object? Something that's intangible, yet profoundly impactful?

I'm going to take a chance and propose an answer: (D) Information!

When you don't have information, you often want it, right? You're curious, seeking answers, or trying to learn more. But when you finally receive that information, you might not necessarily "know" what to do with it, how to process it, or what it truly means. The information might be overwhelming, or it might lead to more questions!

A:
D B
What a intriguing set of clues!

Let's break it down:

* "You are sad upon my arrival, but to some I'm close to a miracle": This suggests that your arrival has a bittersweet quality to it. Some people might see your arrival as a positive, life-changing event, while others (like me) might be disappointed or upset.
* "I ruin your plans": This implies that your arrival has a significant impact on my plans or expectations. You're not just showing up; you're disrupting my life in some way.
* "and yet I wouldn't survive without you": This is the crux of the matter. Despite the chaos you bring, I'm dependent on you in some fundamental way.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer.

I think the correct answer is (B) dark. Here's my reasoning:

* "Sad upon my arrival" could refer to the darkness that arrives when the lights go out or when something ominous happens.
* "Close to a miracle" could imply that darkness can be a catalyst for change or a turning point in someone's life.
* "Ruin my plans" could mean that your arrival brings an unexpected twist or challenge that disrupts my plans or expectations.
* "Wouldn't survive without you" could suggest that I need the darkness to exist or thrive in some way.

In this scenario, I'm a creature of the night, and your arrival might be a game-changer for me. I might despise the disruption you bring, but I wouldn't be able to survive without the darkness that you represent.

The riddle states:

"The things I bite, they don't bleed, I don't bite until you push me..."

Hmm... something that bites, but doesn't bite until it's pushed. That's a great clue!

Next line: "I bring my victims together each time I bite, But they'll come undone if you pull it just right."

This part is intriguing! What could be biting things together, and then come undone if pulled correctly?

After careful consideration, I think I've got it! 

I believe the answer is (A) stapler!

Here's my reasoning:

* "The things I bite, they don't bleed" - A stapler bites paper, but it doesn't bleed.
* "I don't bite until you push me" - You need to push the stapler's mechanism to make it bite (staple).
* "I bring my victims together each time I bite" - The stapler binds papers together, bringing them together.
* "But they'll come undone if you pull it just right" - If you carefully pull the staples out, the papers will come undone.

But what if "me" refers to the speaker themselves? You see, the phrase "every step I take" makes me think of... (drumroll please)... one's own reflection!

* "Floaty" implies something that's light and airy, possibly something that can rise or float in the air.
* "Fun" reinforces the idea that it's an enjoyable experience.
* "Until they explode" - Oh no! Something that was previously fun and enjoyable is now causing fear and surprise.
* "Give you a little scare" - Ah, the aftermath of the explosion! It's not just a casual, everyday experience, but something that's exciting and perhaps even a little frightening.

A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle! I love the creative language used here. Let's indeed think step by step...

You are always there, which means you exist consistently, yet you are some distance away, which implies you're not physically close. This makes me think of something that can be perceived or experienced, rather than a physical object.

The phrase "somewhere between land or sea and sky" is intriguing. It's not a specific location, but rather a general context. This could suggest that you're related to the environment, the world around us.

Now, the next line: "you may move toward me, yet distant I'll stay." This is where things get interesting! It implies that even if someone tries to approach or get closer to you, you'll still maintain a certain distance. This makes me think of something that can be perceived or experienced, but not physically touched or grasped.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose option (B) horizon! The horizon is always there, a distant boundary between the land, sea, and sky. You can move toward it, but you'll never reach it, as it's always receding. The horizon is a mental and visual concept, not a physical location. What do you think? Am I correct?

Q: What moves without seeing and cries without eyes? Answer Choices: (A) space (B) light (C) play (D) shadow (E) cloud
A:
E B
What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down together. The question asks what moves without seeing and cries without eyes. This already gives us some interesting clues.

Firstly, "moves" can be interpreted as something that changes position or location. So, whatever it is, it's capable of changing its position without having the ability to see.

Next, "cries" implies some kind of emotional response. But, since it "cries without eyes," it can't be a living being that sees the world. This suggests that whatever it is, it might not be a biological entity.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Space is an interesting option, but it doesn't quite fit the "cries" part of the description.

(B) Light is also an interesting option, but it doesn't move in the classical sense, and it doesn't cry either.

(C) Play is an abstract concept, and while it can be seen as a form of movement (e.g., playing a game), it doesn't quite fit the "cries" description.

(D) Shadow is an intriguing option. Shadows can move and change shape without eyes, and they can also be seen as having a certain emotional quality to them (e.g., a shadow can loom over something, creating a sense of foreboding). And while shadows don't cry in the classical sense, they can be seen as "crying out" or "screaming" in a figurative sense.

(E) Cloud is another interesting option. Clouds can change shape and move across the sky without eyes, and they can also be seen as having a certain emotional quality to them (e.g., a stormy cloud can be seen as ominous). However, clouds don't typically "cry" in the classical sense.

Based on our analysis, I think the answer is (D) Shadow. Shadows can be seen as moving and changing without eyes, and while they don't cry in the classical sense, they can be seen as having a certain emotional quality to them that can be interpreted as "crying" or "screaming" in a figurative sense.

Hmm... This line suggests that whatever "I" am, I have the ability to open something that the speaker cannot open, no matter how hard they try.

"If it wasn't for me, on your front porch you would stand."

Ah-ha! This line implies that the speaker would be standing somewhere, specifically on the front porch, if it weren't for the presence of "me".

Now, let's connect the dots!

I think "I" might be a "post"!

2. "takes three left turns in a square": This is the key part. He's making three left turns, which means he's essentially turning back on himself three times. If he were to take three right turns, he'd end up facing the same direction as when he started. But since he's taking left turns, that means he's changing direction each time.
3. "comes home": He returns to the starting point, his home.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Round: No, this doesn't fit, as the man would need to take turns in a circular motion, but that's not specified.

(B) Chess board: Ah, this is an interesting possibility! Imagine the man standing on a chessboard, with each square representing a "home" base. He takes three left turns, moving around the board, and eventually ends up back at the starting square (his "home"). This could be a clever answer!

(C) Baseball: This one's a bit of a stretch, but hear me out. Imagine the man standing on a baseball diamond, with the three bases representing "homes" in a sense. He takes three left turns, running around the bases, and ends up back at the starting point (home plate). Not the most likely answer, but it's an outside-the-box possibility!

(D) Four corners: This could work, but it's not the most intuitive solution. Imagine the man standing in a square with four corners. He takes three left turns, moving around the square, and eventually ends up back at the starting point (one of the four corners). This is a viable answer!

(E) Pond: This one's a bit of a stretch, but imagine a pond with a walking path around it. The man starts at the edge of the pond and takes three left turns, walking around the pond. Eventually, he ends up back at

Q: As a whole, I am both safe and secure.   Behead me, and I become a place of meeting.   Behead me again, and I am the partner of ready.   Restore me, and I become the domain of beasts.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) wife of (B) poll (C) detestable (D) Dissolve (E) stable
A:
E A
What a clever riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

As a whole, you are both safe and secure, which suggests that you are a physical structure or a location.

"Behead me, and I become a place of meeting" - This line makes me think of a word that can be altered by removing a part of it. I'm going to take a guess that "behead" means to remove the head of a word, which is a common linguistic phenomenon. If that's the case, then removing the head of a word that means "safe and secure" could result in a word that refers to a place where people meet. Hmm...

"Behead me again, and I am the partner of ready" - This line adds another layer of complexity! If removing the head of a word once makes it a place of meeting, then removing the head again could result in a word that refers to something that is ready or prepared. This makes me think of a word that is often paired with "ready" or "prepared".

"Restore me, and I become the domain of beasts" - This line is a bit more abstract, but it suggests that if we restore the original word, it becomes a place where beasts or wild animals inhabit.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is (E) stable.

Here's my reasoning:

* As a whole, a stable is a safe and secure structure.
* Beheading "stable" (removing the head "sta-") results in "able", which can refer to a place where people meet (an able-bodied individual might be able to meet with others).
* Beheading "able" again (removing the head "ab-") results in "le", which can be the partner of "ready" (e.g., "at the ready" or "prepared to

I'm imagining a sharp-tongued diplomat, a mediator with a keen mind and a quick wit, who can navigate even the most contentious disputes with ease and precision.

And then, it hit me! The answer is... (C) Cane!

A cane, you see, can be a tool for settling disputes in a quiet, unassuming way. It's a sharp-edged wit, if you will, that can "guide" people towards a peaceful resolution, all without making a peep!

A:

What a delightfully slimy scenario!

Let's take a step back and examine the clues:

* "A hole leading in" - This suggests an entrance or an opening that allows something to enter or flow into the cavern.
* "a hole leading out" - This implies an exit or an opening that allows something to exit or flow out of the cavern.
* "we connect to a cavern" - This suggests that the holes are part of a larger structure or system that connects to a cavernous space.
* "that is slimey all throughout" - Ah, the slimey part! This adds a fascinating twist, implying that the cavern itself is covered in a sticky, gooey substance.

Now, let's think creatively... 

Hmmm... What could be a system that has holes leading in and out, connects to a cavern, and is covered in slime?

Ah-ha! I think I've got it!

The answer is... (drumroll please)... (A) your nose!

Think about it:

* The holes leading in and out could be the nostrils, which allow air to enter and exit the nasal cavity.
* The cavern could be the nasal passages, which connect the nostrils to the back of the throat.
* And, of course, the slimey part could refer to the mucus that lines the nasal passages and helps to filter and humidify the air we breathe!

So, there you have it! The correct answer is (A) your nose!

I love a good challenge!

Let's break it down:

1. A thing that falls... This could be anything that drops or descends from a higher place to a lower place.
2....but never gets hurt... This is the key part! Something that falls but doesn't get hurt, which means it's not living or sentient. It's also not something that can be damaged in the classical sense (e.g., a fragile vase).

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (drumroll please)... (D) place!

Why? Well, a place can "fall" in the sense that it can be changed or altered, like a landscape or a location. But a place itself can't get hurt, as it's just a concept or a physical space. It's not a living or sentient being that can experience pain or injury.

A) Liner: Hmm, a liner is something used to create a boundary or a protective layer, but I'm not sure how it could be used to kill...

B) Sword: Ah-ha! A sword is a great example! It's used to protect oneself in combat, but it can also be used to inflict harm and even kill...

C) Support: Support is a wonderful concept, but I'm not sure how it could be used to protect or harm someone...

D) Wedding: A wedding is a joyful celebration, but I'm not sure how it could be used to protect or harm someone...

E) Shield: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A shield is often used to protect oneself from harm, but it can also be used to deflect or block attacks, which could ultimately lead to harm or even death...

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is... B) Sword!

Sunflowers are a possibility, but they're already named after the sun, so that might not be the case.

Let's not get burned out just yet! What other light sources could it be named after?

Ah-ha! What about Lychnis? It's a genus of plants that includes species like the rose campion and the catchfly. The name "Lychnis" comes from the Greek word for "torch" or "lamp," which is a type of light source!

A:

What a fascinating question!

Hmmm... The offspring of a circle and a rectangle... That's like asking about the love child of a smooth, continuous curve and a boxy, angular shape!

Let's break it down:

* A circle has no beginning or end, just a continuous curve.
* A rectangle has four straight sides and four right angles.

If we combine these two, we get a shape that has the smooth, curved aspect of a circle, but also has the angular, straight edges of a rectangle.

And that's when it hits me!

The answer is... (E) Oval!

An oval is a shape that has the characteristics of both a circle and a rectangle. It's a curved shape with a smooth, continuous surface, but it also has a defined beginning and end, just like a rectangle. And, of course, it has no sharp corners like a rectangle, but rather a gentle, curved edge.

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"I come from a mine" - This suggests that the answer is a resource that is extracted from the earth.

"and get surrounded by wood" - This is an intriguing clue! It could imply that the answer is somehow related to wood or is often found near wood.

"Everyone uses me" - This suggests that the answer is something that is quite common and ubiquitous.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill!

What if the answer is a "PENCIL"?

Here's my reasoning:

* "I come from a mine" - Graphite, a key component of pencils, is often extracted from graphite mines.
* "and get surrounded by wood" - Pencils typically have wooden casings!
* "Everyone uses me" - Ah, who doesn't love a good pencil?

Let's start by breaking it down:

* A dog that "sits" implies it's not a typical activity for dogs, so we need to think outside the box.
* "Sizzles next to a fire" is quite an intriguing detail. It suggests the dog is somehow involved with heat or flames.
* Now, let's examine each answer choice:

(A) Basset doesn't quite fit, as basset hounds are a breed of dog known for their distinctive appearance, not their affinity for fires.
(B) Hotdog... Ah, wait a minute! Hotdogs are often grilled over an open flame! Could this be the connection we're looking for?
(C) Bob is a common human name, but it doesn't seem related to dogs or fires.
(D) Petting zoo is a place where animals are typically handled and cuddled, not sizzling next to fires.
(E) Elkhound is another dog breed, but it doesn't seem relevant to this scenario.

Given the connection between hotdogs and grilling, I think the correct answer is...

(B) Hotdog!

A:
D A
What a clever riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I am as strong as seven men." - This implies that whatever "I" is, it has immense strength, possibly even more than seven individual men combined.
* "I am as tall as seven men." - This suggests that "I" is quite tall, possibly even taller than seven individual men standing back to back.
* "Yet seven men can not stand me on my end." - Ah, but here's the catch! This implies that whatever "I" is, it's not something that can be stood upright on its end, no matter how many men try.

Hmm... Considering these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and choose... (E) net!

Why? Well, a net is incredibly strong, able to withstand the weight of many objects or people. It's also quite tall, as you can imagine a massive fishing net or a net used in construction. However, a net is not something that can be stood upright on its end, as it's essentially a flat, two-dimensional structure.

Hmm, that's a good start! There are many things that can be black, but which one is quick as a flash?

* "...and quick as a flash?"
Ah-ha! That's a great clue! Something that's quick as a flash is usually associated with speed, agility, and sudden movement.

Now, let's revisit the options:

(A) Salt is not quick as a flash. It's a substance, not a living thing.
(B) Road is not quick as a flash either. It's a path, not a living thing, and it's not typically associated with speed or sudden movement.
(C) Sand is not quick as a flash either. While it can be moved quickly, it's not typically associated with sudden, swift movement.
(D) Part is a bit of a vague option. While a part can be quick, it's not typically associated with the phrase "quick as a flash."
(E) Squirrel! Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Squirrels are quick, agile, and swift, which fits the description "quick as a flash" perfectly!

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (C) coin!

Let's take a step back and ponder the dual meaning of the Latin word. It's a clever play on words, isn't it?

First, the word means "many". This could be related to a plural noun, implying a group or multitude of something.

Now, let's consider the second meaning: "bloodsucking creatures". This is a rather...unsettling meaning, but it's an important clue!

As I ponder these two meanings, I start to envision a connection between the two. Ah-ha! I think I see a pattern emerging...

Could the answer be... (D) vampires?

Vampires are indeed bloodsucking creatures, and in Latin, the word "plures" can mean "many" or "plural". The connection is that vampires often congregate in groups, making the word "plures" a fitting description of these creatures!

Hmmm... Putting these two phrases together, I'm going to take a wild guess:

Are you... a BONE CAVITY?!

You know, the cavities inside our teeth that can be affected by tooth decay? It's a dark, hollow space (like a cave) filled with tiny, bony structures (like bones).

What a intriguing puzzle! Let's break it down together.

You have streets, but no pavement. This tells me that the streets aren't physical paths with a surface, but rather a concept or a representation of streets.

You have cities, but no buildings. This suggests that the cities aren't actual settlements with structures, but rather a conceptual or symbolic representation of cities.

You have forests, but no trees. This implies that the forests aren't physical areas with vegetation, but rather a metaphorical or abstract representation of forests.

You have rivers, but no water. This suggests that the rivers aren't actual bodies of water, but rather a symbolic or conceptual representation of rivers.

What a fascinating question!

Let's start by considering the phrase "ancient suit." This suggests that we're looking at a type of attire that's been around for a long time, perhaps even thousands of years. This eliminates option (A) shirt, as shirts as we know them today are a relatively modern invention.

Next, we have options (B) armor, (C) helmet, and (D) shirt and trousers. Armor and helmet are both pieces of protective gear that were commonly worn in ancient times, but they're not typically considered a "suit" in the classical sense. Shirt and trousers, on the other hand, could be part of a suit, but it's not the most common or historically accurate pairing.

And then, there's option (E) hair. Now, this is where things get interesting! In ancient cultures, hairstyles were often an integral part of a person's attire, and some hairstyles were even considered a symbol of status or social standing. So, what if we're not looking at a suit of clothes at all, but rather a suit of hair?

Imagine an ancient warrior or dignitary with a towering hairstyle, adorned with feathers, shells, or other ornaments. This could be a suit of hair that's not worn with a tie, but rather with a sense of pride and cultural heritage. It's a creative, outside-the-box answer that challenges our traditional notions of what constitutes a "suit."

So, my answer is: (E) hair!

Let's start by analyzing the characteristics:

* "Yellow and furry" - This suggests that our mysterious feline is indeed a type of cat, possibly with a yellow or golden coat.
* "But not cuddly" - Hmm, this means our cat isn't the snuggly, affectionate type. Perhaps it's more independent or aloof?
* "You can't hold it and snuggle" - Okay, so it's not a domesticated cat you can cuddle on your lap. This implies that our cat might be more wild or free-roaming.
* "But it is still a feline" - Ah, this clarifies that we're still dealing with a member of the Felidae family!

Taking all these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is... (B) lion!

Yes, you read that right! A lion is a type of feline, and while it's not cuddly or snuggly, it's definitely furry and yellow (or golden). You can't hold it and snuggle, as they're wild animals, but they're still majestic and awe-inspiring felines.

2. "I have a space but no room." - This implies that the "space" is not a physical space, but rather a conceptual one.
3. "You can enter, but cannot go outside." - This is where it gets interesting! It seems that "entering" is not about physically moving outside, but rather about accessing or engaging with something.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

(A) Satchel: It has a space (the bag itself) but no room, and you can put things in it, but you can't go outside with it.

(B) Skeleton: It has keys (the bony fingers) but no locks, and you can enter the skeleton's "space" (the bones), but you can't go outside because it's a lifeless structure.

(C) Keyboard: Ah-ha! This is where things get fascinating! A keyboard has keys (the typing keys) but no locks, and you can enter text or commands into the "space" (the digital realm), but you can't go outside because it's a device confined to a specific space.

(D) Party: While a party has a "space" (the event venue), it's hard to see how you can "enter" a party without going outside (physically attending the party).

(E) Folding chair: It has a "space" (the seat and backrest), but it's not a physical room, and you can enter the chair (sit in it), but you can't go outside because it's a stationary object.

Now, considering the possibilities, I think the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... (C) Keyboard!

A:
B E
What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "I touch the Earth": This implies that the answer is in close proximity to the ground.
* "I touch the sky": This suggests that the answer has a connection to the atmosphere or the heavens.
* "but if I touch you, you'll likely die": This is the most crucial part of the riddle. It implies that the answer is something that can cause harm or even death if it comes into contact with a living being.

With these clues in mind, I'd like to propose a creative answer that fits the bill:

Are you... (drumroll please)... an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)?

Here's how it fits:

* "I touch the Earth": EMPs can be generated by natural phenomena, such as lightning strikes, or man-made sources, like nuclear explosions. In both cases, the EMP can interact with the Earth's magnetic field.
* "I touch the sky": EMPs can also affect the atmosphere, potentially disrupting communication systems and other electronic devices.
* "but if I touch you, you'll likely die": If a person were to be directly exposed to a powerful EMP, it could potentially cause harm or even death due to the disruption of vital electronic systems in their body, such as pacemakers or other medical devices.

A:

What a fascinating puzzle! Let's dive in and see where our creative minds take us!

I love that you suggested thinking step by step. That's exactly what I'll do.

Here's my thought process:

* "I am the beginning of eternity"... Hmm, eternity is a pretty big concept. It makes me think of... the letter "E"! Is it possible that the answer is the letter "E", which is the starting letter of the word "eternity"?
* "and the end of time and space"... This part makes me think of the word "E" again! Time and space are vast concepts, but if we break them down, "E" is the last letter of the word "time" and the last letter of the word "space" too!
* "I am the beginning of every end"... This part makes me think of the word "END", which starts with the letter "E" again!
* "and the end of every place"... Ah, the word "place" ends with the letter "E" too!

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is indeed (A) E! What do you think? Am I on the right track?

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I have three eyes, all in a line": This suggests that whatever we're looking for has three distinct features or components that are aligned in a row.
2. "When the red one opens, all freezes": This implies that when one of these components or eyes opens, everything comes to a standstill.

Hmmm... What could this be?

I'm going to take a chance and propose an unconventional answer. What if the correct answer is... (D) traffic light?

Here's my reasoning:

* The three eyes in a line could represent the three colors of a traffic light: red, yellow, and green.
* When the red eye (or the red light) opens, it means the light has turned red, and all traffic (vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) freezes or comes to a halt.

Am I on the right track?

A classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's break it down, step by step, just like you said!

1. "What weighs exactly 2,000 pounds?"
Hmm, that's a specific weight, so it's likely not a living thing (unless we're talking about a very large animal, but that's not a common answer choice).

2. "Approximation" (A) is a bit of an abstract concept, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.

3. "Ton" (B) is a unit of weight, and 2,000 pounds is equal to 1 ton! Ah-ha!

So, the correct answer is (B) ton!

Hmmm... Let's break it down:

* "Dressed when night falls" - Ah-ha! This could mean that whatever it is, it's covered or "dressed" in something during nighttime.
* "Undressed when day breaks" - And this could mean that whatever it is, it sheds or loses that covering when the sun rises.

Now, let's consider each option:

(A) Fire - Nope, fire isn't dressed or undressed in the classical sense.
(B) Black - Hmm, black isn't a physical object that can be dressed or undressed.
(C) Undies - Ah, but underwear can be worn (dressed) at night and removed (undressed) in the morning! Could this be the answer?

What a delightfully relaxed question!

Let's start by considering the phrase "laid-back member of the animal kingdom." This phrase implies that the animal in question is not only relaxed but also a part of the animal kingdom.

Option (A) sloth is a great candidate, as sloths are notorious for their slow pace and relaxed demeanor. However, "breath" (option B) doesn't quite fit, as it's not an animal.

Option (C) mobile doesn't make sense, as it's not an animal either. And option (D) animals is a bit too broad, as it's not a specific type of animal.

That leaves us with option (E) laid back, which is a clever answer, but not quite what we're looking for.

So, I think the correct answer is indeed (A) sloth!

Let's indeed think step by step...

Carpenters, being the skilled craftsmen they are, would naturally have a strong connection to... NAILS! They work with them, shape them, hammer them, and create something from nothing!

Now, if we're thinking creatively, what kind of nails would carpenters hate to hit?

Hmm... It can't be staple (A) because that's not even a type of nail!

And, of course, bells and whistles (B) aren't a type of nail either!

Nail polish (C) is a cosmetic product, not a type of nail either!

The carpentry shop (D) is a place where carpenters work, not a type of nail!

So, it has to be... FINGERNAILS (E)! Ah-ha! Carpenter's worst nightmare!

* If I share something, it means I'm giving it to someone else, right?
* And if I still have all for myself, it means I'm keeping it, not losing it.
* Hmm... what can I share without losing it?

And then it hit me! 

The answer is (B) knowledge!

When I share knowledge, I'm not losing it; I'm simply passing it on to someone else. In fact, sharing knowledge often helps me retain it better and expand my own understanding. It's like the old saying goes: "The more you give, the more you receive!"

Q: what goes up but never comes down   you wont see it looking down at the ground Answer Choices: (A) life (B) show (C) land (D) stars (E) time
A:
D D
What a clever question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Hmm, what goes up but never comes down"... That already gives me a hint that it's not something that moves vertically up and down, like an elevator or a ball. It's not a living thing, like an animal or a plant, that can move up but eventually come back down.

"you won't see it looking down at the ground"... That's a great clue! It means that whatever it is, it's not something that we typically look at from a downward perspective. We don't usually gaze down at the ground to observe it.

With these hints in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the correct answer is (D) stars!

Here's my reasoning: Stars are always "up" in the sense that they're in the sky, but they don't physically come down to the ground. We don't look down at the ground to see stars; we look up at the sky to see them. And even if we were to somehow travel to the stars, we wouldn't be looking down at the ground, we'd be looking out at the vastness of space!

A:

Let's indeed think step by step...

We know that the answer is something that teachers use in school. That's a great starting point!

You start out long... That's an interesting clue! It makes me think of something that has a certain length or dimension initially.

Then, you become short... Ah-ha! That's a clever twist! So, whatever it is, it undergoes a transformation from long to short.

Now, let's review our answer choices:

A) Horse: Hmm, not sure how a horse would fit the bill... it's not typically used in school, and it's not necessarily long or short.

B) Shorter person: That's an intriguing option, but it doesn't quite fit the bill... we're looking for something that teachers use in school, not a person.

C) Pencil: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A pencil starts out long (think of a pencil with an eraser on the end) and becomes short (as you use it up and it gets shorter and shorter)...

D) British Crown: Not quite sure how this fits the bill... it's not typically used in school, and it's not really something that changes length.

E) Classrooms: Nope, that's not it... classrooms don't change length!

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is... C) Pencil! What do you think? Am I correct?

"What runs but never walks?" - This part of the question is likely referring to something that moves or flows, but doesn't have legs or the ability to walk.

Hmmm... With these two clues, I'm going to take a chance and choose option (A) river.

What a intriguing riddle! Let's unravel it together, shall we?

"Few to the wise" - Hmm, what could be few to those who are wise? Ah-ha! I think I have it! Could it be that words are few to the wise? Wise individuals often speak little, yet their words carry great weight. 

"Abundant to the drunken" - Ooh, this one's a bit trickier! But wait, what's something that's plentiful when people are in a state of altered consciousness? Ah, yes! I think it's words! When people are drunk, they often speak freely, sharing their thoughts and feelings with reckless abandon. 

"Calm the beast" - Mmm, this one's got me thinking about taming the savage beast within! And what's a great way to calm the savage beast? Ah, words! Words can soothe the savage beast, calming its savage heart. 

"Precious to the child" - Ah, this one's got me thinking about the way children often treasure words! Children love to hear stories, and words are precious to them because they hold the power to transport them to fantastical worlds. 

"Devour the heart, without piercing the skin" - Ooh, this one's got me thinking about the way words can pierce our hearts without causing physical harm! Words can break our hearts, but they don't leave scars.

A:
D D
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Round as a button": This suggests something circular in shape.
2. "Deep as a well": This implies that the object is not only circular but also has a significant depth or cavity.
3. "If you want me to talk, You must first pull my tail": This phrase is the most intriguing part! It seems to imply that the object has a tail, and when that tail is pulled, it becomes talkative.

Hmm... Which answer choice fits this description?

Let's consider each option:

(A) Congo: Not a great fit, as it's a region and doesn't have a tail or a deep cavity.

(B) Converse: This is a type of shoe, which doesn't match the description either. But, we do have the word "con" in it, which could be relevant...

(C) Radio: Radios don't have tails or deep cavities, but they do have a "pull" mechanism (e.g., a volume knob or a tuning dial). This might be a good lead!

(D) Bell: Ah-ha! Bells are often depicted as having a clapper or a "tail" that can be pulled to make them ring. And bells can be deep or have a significant cavity inside. This is getting interesting!

(E) Ring: Rings are often circular and can have a deep cavity (like a ring-shaped container), but they don't typically have a tail that can be pulled.

Based on these observations, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is (D) Bell! What do you think?

Let's take a deep breath and dive into the world of possibilities...

Since the answer is something that "no man ever yet did see", it implies that it's not a physical object or a tangible entity. It's something more abstract, perhaps?

The phrase "which never was" suggests that it didn't exist in the past. However, the phrase "but always is to be" implies that it will always exist in the future.

Hmm... I'm thinking...

Could it be... the concept of "tomorrow"? Tomorrow is a future time that never existed in the past, but it will always exist in the future. Every day, tomorrow becomes today, but the concept of tomorrow itself remains constant.

Hmm... Could it be something that serves a crucial purpose, but can also be misused with disastrous consequences?

* Some live by it: Guns can be used for self-defense, hunting, or protection.
* Some die by it: Guns can be used to commit violent crimes, leading to loss of life.

I'm going to take a moment to ponder... Ah-ha! I think I have it!

The correct answer is (C) postage stamp!

Here's my reasoning:

A postage stamp can travel around the world on a letter or package, but it will always stay in the corner of an envelope or package. It's a clever play on words, isn't it?

Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, what about the other options?" Well, a plow can't really travel around the world, and even if it did, it wouldn't necessarily stay in a corner. "Run" is a verb, not a physical object that can travel. The corner of the moon is a fixed location, not a place that a postage stamp could travel to. And a painting is a two-dimensional work of art that can't physically travel at all!

So, the correct answer is indeed the postage stamp!

A:
A A
What a delightful question! Let's embark on a creative journey to uncover the answer!

Hmmm... Something that's so light it could float on water... That's a great starting point!

And then, there's the twist: no man could carry it. Ah, now we're getting somewhere!

I think we need to consider something that's incredibly light, yet its volume or mass is too great for a human to lift or carry.

Now, let's weigh our options:

A) Bubble: Ah, yes! A bubble is indeed very light and could float on water. But, it's not something a man couldn't carry...

B) Kelp: Kelp is a type of seaweed, but it's still a solid object, and its weight wouldn't be negligible. It's not the right fit.

C) Sand box: A sand box is a container, not the actual sand itself. Sand is quite heavy, so it wouldn't fit the "light" criteria. And, it's not something a man couldn't carry...

D) Water horsetail: I'm not familiar with this term, and a quick search didn't yield any information. It's possible it's a made-up option or a very specific, obscure term. Let's move on!

E) River: A river is a massive body of water, not something a man could carry or even attempt to lift!

Ah-ha! I think we have our answer!

The correct answer is... A) Bubble!

A bubble is incredibly light, and its buoyancy allows it to float on water. However, the sheer number of bubbles needed to make a significant volume would be impossible for a human to carry. You'd need a massive quantity of bubbles, and that would be quite a challenge!

So, there you have it! The correct answer is indeed A) Bubble!

Now, let's celebrate our creative problem-solving skills!

Q: i grow on a farm orange and used but then get thrown away what am i? Answer Choices: (A) pumpkin (B) fruit stand (C) color (D) jam (E) sweet
A:
A A
What a juicy question!

Let's peel back the layers (pun intended!)...

You grow on a farm, which means you're a type of plant. And you're orange, which suggests a specific color. Hmm...

You're used, but then get thrown away... That's a bit of a bitter pill to swallow!

But, let's think outside the box (or basket, in this case!)... What if you're not just a plain old orange?

Could you be a type of orange that's used for a specific purpose, like a pumpkin? Pumpkins are often grown on farms, they're orange, and sometimes they get used for decoration or cooking, but sometimes they get thrown away. That's a possibility!

But, let's not stop there! We can take a different route... What if you're not a type of orange at all? What if you're something that's often associated with oranges, like a fruit stand? Fruit stands often sell oranges, and sometimes they might get thrown away if they're not sold. That's a thought!

Or, we could think about the color orange itself... You could be a representation of the color orange, which is often associated with warmth, happiness, and sunshine. But, in this case, you're getting thrown away, which is a bit of a downer!

So, which option do I choose? Hmm... I think I'll go with... A) Pumpkin! You grow on a farm, you're orange, and sometimes you get used and then thrown away. Plus, pumpkins are often seen as a symbol of abundance and harvest, so it's a bit of a bittersweet answer!

What do you think? Am I correct, or am I just growing a little too attached to my answer?

Q: You can hold me in your hand and yet I can fill the entire room.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) side chair (B) light bulb (C) play (D) hair (E) war room
A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

You say I can hold you in my hand, which means I'm something that's small enough to be grasped by a human hand. That's a great starting point!

And then, you add that I can fill the entire room, which suggests that I'm something that can take up a significant amount of space, perhaps even occupy the entire area.

Hmm... That's a clever combination!

As I ponder this, I'm tempted to rule out the more physical objects like the chair, light bulb, or play (which doesn't really fit the hand-to-room dichotomy).

Now, let's consider the remaining options: hair and war room.

Hair is an intriguing possibility, but it's unlikely to fill an entire room, unless we're talking about a giant hairball or a hair-based art installation (which might be a creative answer, but not the most conventional one).

War room, on the other hand, is an interesting choice. A war room is typically a dedicated space used for strategic planning, and while it might not be held in one's hand, it can certainly occupy a large area. But, in this context, it seems a bit too literal.

So, I'm going to take a leap and propose a creative answer that combines the two seemingly contradictory aspects of the riddle:

What if I'm a concept, an idea, or a feeling? You can hold the concept of a "room" in your hand, as in, a thought or a notion, but it can also fill the entire room as a metaphorical or emotional presence.

Am I onto something here, or am I just getting carried away with my creative thinking?

* It has many mouths. Ah, now we're getting somewhere!

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (C) books!

Here's my reasoning:

* Books have a body (the physical book itself), but no head, legs, eyes, nose, ears, or feet.
* When you ask a question, a book can "answer" by providing information or guidance through its content.
* And, many books have many mouths... or rather, many pages that contain text!

Q: What gives you the strength and power to walk through walls? Answer Choices: (A) doors (B) ceilings (C) mind (D) spirit (E) force
A:
A E
What a fascinating question!

As I ponder the options, I realize that the correct answer might not be what we typically think of as "strength" or "power." It's not about physical barriers like doors or ceilings, nor is it about our physical minds or spirits.

Hmmm... Let me take a step back and think about the essence of walking through walls. Is it not about the ability to transcend boundaries, to break free from constraints, and to find new paths?

In that case, the correct answer is not something tangible, but rather an abstract concept. It's... (drumroll please)... the FORCE of imagination!

With a powerful imagination, we can walk through walls of doubt, fear, and limitation, and find new opportunities and perspectives. It's the spark that ignites our creativity, propels us forward, and gives us the confidence to take bold steps into the unknown.

So, the correct answer is (E) force, but not just any force – the force of imagination, which is the ultimate key to unlocking our full potential!

A:
C A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. Here's my creative approach:

1. "Though liquid in nature" - This tells me that the answer is something that's typically considered a liquid, but...
2. "don't push me too far" - This phrase suggests that the liquid has a limit or a boundary beyond which it becomes unstable or changes its state.
3. "for then I will break" - Ah, the liquid breaks or shatters when pushed too far! This implies that the liquid has a specific structure or cohesion that can be disrupted.
4. "and the damage may scar" - This final phrase hints at the consequences of pushing the liquid too far: it might leave a lasting impact or a "scar".

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose... (C) glass!

Here's my reasoning: Glass is a liquid in its molten state, but it can shatter or break when subjected to sudden or excessive pressure. The damage caused by such breaking can indeed leave a scar or a crack in the glass.

Q: There was a man dead and in a coffin.  stood next to the dead man was another man.  the door opened and another man walked in and said to the man next to the coffin "who is this man to you".  the man replied with " brothers and sisters i have none but this mans father is my fathers son". . . .  who is the dead man to the man stood next to him???????? Answer Choices: (A) cousin (B) adult (C) baby (D) his son (E) alive
A:
D D
What a delightful puzzle! Let's break it down together.

The man next to the coffin says, "Brothers and sisters I have none, but this man's father is my father's son."

This statement is a bit cryptic, but it's saying that the father of the dead man is the son of the man standing next to the coffin. In other words, the father of the dead man is the man standing next to the coffin's son.

Now, let's think about the possibilities:

* If the man standing next to the coffin was the father, then the statement would be saying "my father's son is my father", which doesn't make sense.
* If the man standing next to the coffin was the grandfather, then the statement would be saying "my father's son is my grandson", which also doesn't make sense.

But wait! What if the man standing next to the coffin is the husband of the dead man? That would mean the statement is saying "my father's son is my son-in-law", which is a possible scenario.

So, taking all this into account, I'm going to take a chance and say that the dead man is the husband of the man standing next to the coffin.

Which means the correct answer is... (D) his son!

A:
C A
What a clever question!

Hmmm... Let's break it down:

* "What has a bed but does not sleep": This tells me that the answer is something that has a physical space or area where a bed could be placed, but it itself doesn't sleep. It could be a physical structure, a room, or even a vehicle!
* "and can run but cannot walk": This adds another layer of intrigue! Something that can "run" implies movement or transportation, but it can't walk. This could mean it's not capable of walking on two legs, but maybe it can move in other ways?

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is... (C) river!

A river has a "bed" or a channel where it flows, but it doesn't sleep. Rivers can also "run" or flow, but they don't have legs to walk with. Am I correct?

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's start by breaking it down:

1. You're bigger than Venus: That means you're quite large, so it's unlikely to be something microscopic.
2. You're smaller than Uranus: Okay, so you're not a massive planet or a galaxy. That helps narrow it down.
3. You're a living rock: This is an intriguing clue! Rocks aren't typically considered living, so there must be something special about you.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be on the traditional list of options:

What if you're a living, breathing mountain range? Think about it - mountains are made of rock, and some mountain ranges are indeed quite large, spanning thousands of square miles. While they're not "living" in the classical sense, they do have a sort of "life" in that they're constantly changing shape due to weathering, erosion, and geological activity. And, of course, some mountain ranges are even bigger than Venus!

Of course, this answer might not be entirely literal, but I hope it's a creative and outside-the-box solution that sparks some imagination!

Hmmm... What could it be?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The answer is... (C) RUSH!

Think about it: Rush is a concept that can refer to a sense of urgency, a feeling of excitement, or a sudden movement. It's an intangible idea that can be felt or experienced, but it can't be physically moved from one place to another.

When you say "rush" from New York to California, you're essentially conveying a sense of urgency or excitement from the East Coast to the West Coast, without actually moving the word itself. It's like a mental or emotional wave that travels across the country, without ever physically leaving its starting point!

A:
E E
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

The phrase "Many will look and many will see, Only one of the sides of me" makes me think of something that has multiple sides or facets, but only one side is visible or accessible to many. This could be a physical object or a concept.

The phrase "Omitting the crime of looking right" is an interesting hint. It suggests that "looking right" might be a crucial aspect, but we're being told to ignore it for now. This could imply that the correct answer is not a literal direction (e.g., north, south, east, west).

Considering the answer choices, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended).

My initial thought is that the answer might be the moon. The moon has many sides, and only one side (the near side) is visible from Earth. This fits the description of "many will look and many will see, Only one of the sides of me."

The phrase "Omitting the crime of looking right" could be interpreted as not considering the fact that we typically look at the moon from a specific angle (i.e., from the right side). This is a bit of a stretch, I admit, but it's a possible connection.

4. "Come for a ride, just me and you." - This final phrase invites me to imagine an experience that's personal, intimate, and perhaps a bit whimsical.

The line "I take you by night, by day take you back" makes me think of something that can affect us during our rest or sleep, but also has an impact on our daily lives.

2. "Maker of worn wood" - This phrase implies something that creates or shapes wood, and the fact that it's "worn" suggests something that's been in use for a long time.
3. "Shrub-ruster" - Ah, another intriguing phrase! "Shrub-ruster" makes me think of something that affects or manipulates vegetation, possibly in a way that's not always gentle.
4. "Sky-mocker" - This phrase is quite evocative! "Sky-mocker" implies something that's playful, possibly even mischievous, and has a connection to the sky.
5. "Rave!" - An exclamation! This adds a sense of excitement and energy to the description.

Now, let's look at the second set of phrases:

1. "Portly pusher" - This phrase suggests something large and sturdy, possibly used to push or move things.
2. "Wind-slave" - This phrase is quite dramatic! "Wind-slave" implies something that's controlled or manipulated by the wind, possibly in a way that's not always predictable.

Considering these phrases, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think you might be a TREE!

A tree is a many-manned scud-thumper (many people can contribute to its growth), a maker of worn wood (it produces wood that can be worn away by weather), a shrub-ruster (it can outcompete and displace other vegetation), a sky-mocker (it can reach up towards the sky and create shadows), and a rave (it can be a source of excitement and energy

A clever question!

Let's start by acknowledging that the correct answer is likely to be a type of vegetable, given the mention of Bugs Bunny, a cartoon character known for his love of carrots.

Next, let's consider the answer choices. The options (A) kitchen cupboard, (C) salad, and (D) market don't seem to fit the bill. A kitchen cupboard is a physical space, a salad is a dish, and a market is a place where you buy things.

That leaves us with (B) carrot and (E) animal. Since we've already eliminated the other options, it's likely that the correct answer is (B) carrot!

So, the answer is... (drumroll please)... a CARROT!

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle! Let's take a creative stroll to unravel the mystery together!

First, you said "I run through hills; I veer around mountains." Ah-ha! This suggests that whatever you are, it's something that can traverse natural landscapes, like hills and mountains. It's not a fixed object, but rather something that can move or flow.

Next, you mentioned "I leap over rivers." This implies that the thing you are can clear obstacles, like bodies of water. It's not necessarily a physical structure that would be hindered by rivers.

Then, you said "I crawl through the forests." This adds a new layer of nuance, suggesting that the thing you are can adapt to different terrains and environments. It's not just limited to traversing hills and mountains, but can also navigate dense vegetation.

Lastly, you mentioned "Step out your door to find me." Ah, the clincher! This hints that the thing you are is something that's easily accessible, perhaps even ubiquitous. It's not something that requires special knowledge or exploration to find.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap (pun intended) and propose that the answer is... (A) roads!

Roads can indeed run through hills, veer around mountains, leap over rivers (by crossing bridges), and crawl through forests (by winding through dense vegetation). And, of course, you can step out of your door and find a road nearby!

When you're in your room and leaning against something that can be hard but mostly soft, I'm imagining a texture that's quite versatile.

You go to sleep and you're lying down on this... Ah-ha! This implies that the surface is comfortable enough for you to fall asleep on.

When you get up, you're still lying on this... Hmm, that's an interesting clue! It suggests that the surface is likely stationary, not something that moves or changes position.

We know that on Earth, yesterday always comes before today. That's a straightforward concept.

Hmmm... I've got it!

In a dictionary, words are arranged alphabetically, right? So, if we look up a word that starts with "Y" (like "yesterday"), it would come after words that start with "T" (like "today").

So, in a dictionary, yesterday indeed comes after today!

A:
C A
I love a good riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, we have "Nothing on the outside" - This suggests that whatever it is, it doesn't have an external appearance or physical form.

Next, we have "Nothing on the inside" - This implies that it's not just the exterior that's empty, but the interior too. It's not like a hollow object with a physical structure; instead, it's as if it has no substance or content whatsoever.

Then, we have "Light as a feather" - This phrase suggests that whatever it is, it's incredibly lightweight, almost as if it's not even there.

Finally, we have "Yet ten men cannot lift it" - This seems to be the biggest contradiction. If it's so light, why can't ten men lift it? Is it because it's not just physical heaviness that's preventing them from lifting it?

Hmmm... Let me take a leap of creative thinking here...

What if the answer is "Breath"? 

* "Nothing on the outside" refers to the fact that air has no physical form or appearance.
* "Nothing on the inside" suggests that air has no substance or density.
* "Light as a feather" is literally true - air is incredibly light!
* "Yet ten men cannot lift it" makes sense because, while air is light, the combined weight of ten men is still more than the weight of the air they're trying to lift. It's not that the air is heavy, but rather that the air is everywhere and the men can't lift it because it's all around them!

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just blowing hot air?

A:
D B
What a fascinating question! Let's dive into the world of possibilities!

I think the correct answer is (B) attention. You see, attention is a precious resource that can be wasted on trivial things like social media, email notifications, or even staring at the ceiling (we've all been there!). And sometimes, we give our attention away to others, like friends or family, without realizing the value of our own time and focus.

We might spend hours scrolling through our feeds, watching videos, or engaging in conversations that don't bring us closer to our goals or passions. And when we do give our attention to someone else, we might not always get the return we expect, leaving us feeling drained or unfulfilled.

But what if we could harness our attention like a superpower? Imagine being able to focus on what truly matters, like a project we're passionate about, a goal we're striving for, or a person who truly deserves our time and energy.

So, in a way, attention is like a treasure that we often waste or give away without realizing its true value. What do you think? Am I on the right track?

A:
E A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. The foreword comes after the epilogue.
This is already unusual, as forewords typically come before the main content. So, the book might be... reverse-engineered?

2. The end is in the first half of the book.
This implies that the book's climax or conclusion is early on, which could be a clever storytelling technique. Perhaps the book is... a mystery or thriller?

3. The index comes before the introduction.
Ah-ha! This is where things get really interesting! An index is typically used to help readers navigate the book, but if it's at the beginning, it's as if the author is giving away the entire plot! This could be a book that... subverts our expectations?

With these clues in mind, I'd like to propose a creative solution:

The book is... an Atlas!

Think about it: an atlas is a book that usually has an index of places at the beginning, followed by the maps and descriptions. The "end" of the book would be the last page of the atlas, which is actually in the first half of the book. The foreword could be a brief introduction to the concept of geography, and the epilogue could be a final thought on the importance of exploration. And, voilà! We have a book that defies traditional book structure!

So, my answer would be... none of the above options (A-E). What do you think?

Q: The go-to weapon for science fiction heroes Answer Choices: (A) microscopes (B) mine (C) explosive (D) laser (E) shotgun
A:

What a thrilling question!

As we ponder the go-to weapon for science fiction heroes, I'd like to take a detour through the vast expanse of sci-fi history. From the pioneering days of Flash Gordon to the modern era of Guardians of the Galaxy, one thing remains constant – the trusty laser gun!

But, before we settle on D) laser, let's consider the alternatives. A) microscopes are more suited for, well, microscopy, rather than intergalactic battles. B) mines are more like... well, you get the idea – not exactly a hero's weapon. C) explosives might be useful in a pinch, but they're not as... flashy as our next option. And E) shotguns are better suited for close-quarters combat, like on a space station or a planet's surface.

Now, back to our laser... It's a staple in science fiction, offering a sleek, high-tech, and often (but not always) stylish solution for our heroes' battles. From Star Wars' blasters to Star Trek's phasers, lasers have become an iconic symbol of science fiction.

So, with that in mind, I propose that D) laser is indeed the go-to weapon for science fiction heroes. It's a versatile, futuristic, and undeniably cool choice that's hard to beat.

But, what do you think? Am I correct in my assessment, or do you have another option in mind?

A:
D D
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

From the description, I notice that "almost everyone sees me without noticing me." This suggests that whatever "I" am, people are familiar with it, but they might not pay much attention to it.

The next line says, "For what is beyond is what he or she seeks." This implies that whatever is beyond or on the other side of "me" is what people are actually interested in.

With these clues in mind, let's examine each answer choice:

(A) Space Shuttle: People might see a space shuttle without noticing it, but what's beyond is not really what people are seeking (unless they're astronauts!).

(B) Seat: People do see seats all the time, but what's beyond a seat isn't necessarily what people seek.

(C) Tunnel: Tunnels are often overlooked, but what's beyond a tunnel is indeed what people are seeking (e.g., the other side!).

(D) Window: Ah-ha! Windows are often overlooked, and people might not notice them unless they're looking at something outside. And what's beyond a window is indeed what people seek (e.g., a view, a different room, etc.).

(E) Picture: People do see pictures all the time, but what's beyond a picture isn't necessarily what people seek (unless they're art enthusiasts!).

Based on this analysis, I'm going to take a guess that the correct answer is... (D) window!

And then I see the phrase "without any fear." Ah-ha! That's a great clue! It's like the sentence is daring me to take a risk and search for the answer.

But what if I don't find the answer? The sentence reassures me, "but if you Lose do not be afraid for a Loser can learn from his mistakes." It's like the sentence is saying, "Hey, even if you don't find the answer, it's okay! You'll learn something new and become a better search-er!"

A:

What a deliciously tricky riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "You find me behind the stars;" - This line makes me think of something that's celestial, perhaps related to space.
2. "or in a sixth, seventh, or third" - Ah, fractions! This could be referring to something that's divided into parts or has a specific proportion.
3. "it takes something round, a computer, and me to make pie" - Now we have a tangible object (something round), a computer, and... me? This is where things get interesting! The phrase "it takes something round" makes me think of a pie dish or a circle, which could be used to make a pie.
4. "i am bigger than anything you can think of" - This line makes me think of something that's enormous, perhaps even infinite.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a stab at the answer. I think the correct answer is... (E) infinity!

Here's my reasoning:

* "You find me behind the stars" - Infinity is often associated with the vastness of space, which is "behind" the stars.
* "or in a sixth, seventh, or third" - Infinity is often represented mathematically using fractions (e.g., 1/∞, 1/∞, or 1/∞).
* "it takes something round, a computer, and me to make pie" - While this line seems unrelated to infinity at first, think about it this way: infinity is often represented graphically using circles or spheres (something round). A computer can process complex calculations related to infinity. And, if we assume "me" is the riddle itself, then it takes the riddle, a computer, and a graphical representation of infinity (a circle) to "make" the concept of infinity.
* "i am bigger than anything you can think of" - Infinity is, by definition,

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "Sharp to the ears" - Hmm... something that makes a noise or sounds loud to our ears, perhaps?
* "Soft to the touch" - Okay, so it's not rough or prickly, but gentle to the sense of touch. That helps narrow it down a bit!
* "Usually wet" - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Something that's often surrounded by water or moisture, maybe?
* "Lives in a hole" - Ah-ha! So, it's not a living creature (or is it?), but something that can be found in a hole or a cavity. This is getting interesting!

I think the answer is... (drumroll please)... an ECHIDNA! 

An echidna is an animal that lives in a burrow (a hole), and it has a pointed, snout-like nose that makes a distinctive "squeaking" sound when it's threatened or scared (sharp to the ears!). Its fur is also soft to the touch, and echidnas are often found in wet environments, like forests or grasslands. Am I right?

Let's break it down:

* "It occurs once in every minute": This tells us that the answer is something that happens regularly, with a fixed frequency.
* "Twice in every moment": This suggests that the answer is somehow related to the concept of time, as "moments" are a smaller unit of time than "minutes".
* "Yet never in one hundred thousand years": This is the key to the puzzle! It implies that the answer is something that never accumulates or adds up over a long period of time.

Now, let's think outside the box!

I'm going to take a chance and propose that the answer is not a word, but rather a concept: the letter "M".

Here's how it fits:

* "It occurs once in every minute": The letter "M" appears once in every minute, as in "1 minute".
* "Twice in every moment": The letter "M" appears twice in words like "moment" or "moments".
* "Yet never in one hundred thousand years": The letter "M" never accumulates to a significant extent over a long period of time, like one hundred thousand years.

A:
A A
What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, step by step, as you suggested.

1. "It has space but no room." This suggests that the answer is not a physical space with walls, ceiling, and floor, like a room. It could be a metaphorical or abstract space.
2. "It has keys but no doors." This is intriguing! "Keys" often imply access or control, but "no doors" means there's no physical barrier to enter or exit. This could be a hint that the answer is not a physical object or location.
3. "You can enter but not go in." This is a clever clue! "Enter" implies that you're taking an action, but "not go in" suggests that the action doesn't lead to a physical destination. This could be related to the idea of entering data or information, rather than a physical space.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and choose option (A) computer keyboard.

Why? Because a keyboard has a "space" bar, but it's not a physical room. It has keys, but no physical doors. And when you "enter" data on a keyboard, you're not physically going into a space – you're creating digital information!

Let's break it down:

"People call me accordingly." - This suggests that the answer is something that is referred to by a specific name or title.

"Though I'm living, you won't think so." - This is a clever hint that the answer is not what it seems. Despite being "living", the answer is not perceived as being alive.

Now, let's consider each option:

A. Parents - While parents are living, the word "parents" is often used in a more formal or official sense, rather than as a direct reference to the individuals themselves.

B. Class - This option doesn't quite fit, as a class is not typically referred to as "living".

C. Corpse - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A corpse is, indeed, not considered "living". People might call a corpse by a specific name, such as "the deceased" or "the body".

D. Christians - This option seems unlikely, as Christians are very much living individuals.

E. Now - This option doesn't seem to fit the description, as "now" is a time reference rather than a specific name or title.

So, taking everything into account, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the correct answer is... C. Corpse!

Q: I'm made for one but meant for two; I can be worn for many years but usually just a few; You won't ever need me unless you say you do.   What am I? Answer Choices: (A) tie (B) seatbelt (C) night stand (D) wedding ring (E) hat
A:
D B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "I'm made for one but meant for two;" - This line suggests that the answer is something that is designed for an individual, but its purpose is to be shared or used by two people.
2. "I can be worn for many years but usually just a few;" - This line implies that the answer is something that can be used for an extended period, but its lifespan is typically shorter than the number of years it can be used for.
3. "You won't ever need me unless you say you do." - This line suggests that the answer is something that is not essential or necessary, but it becomes important when someone decides they need it.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Tie: A tie can be worn by one person, but it's often used to match or complement another person's outfit. It can be worn for many years, but it may go out of style or be replaced. However, it's not essential unless someone decides to wear it.

B. Seatbelt: A seatbelt is designed for an individual, but it's meant to be used in a vehicle with others. It can be used for many years, but it may become obsolete or need to be replaced. However, it's essential for safety, so it's not exactly what the riddle is looking for.

C. Night stand: A night stand is designed for one person, but it's often used by two people sharing a bed. It can be used for many years, but it may become outdated or replaced. However, it's not essential unless someone decides they need a place to put their phone or book.

D. Wedding ring: Ah-ha! A wedding ring is made for one person, but it's meant to be shared with their partner. It can be worn for many years, but it's often replaced or updated after a

Q: I love to move around, But usually not on the ground.  I'm quite strung out when way up high.  I like to sail, but I need to stay dry.  I need air, but not to breathe.  A helpful hand is all I need.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) kite (B) freshness (C) sound waves (D) run away (E) dish
A:
A A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's take it one step at a time:

1. "I love to move around, But usually not on the ground."
This suggests that the answer is not a living being that walks on the ground, but rather something that can move in the air.
2. "I'm quite strung out when way up high."
Ahah! This implies that the answer is attached to something by a string or cord, and it's lifted high up in the air.
3. "I like to sail, but I need to stay dry."
This phrase makes me think of something that sails through the air, but not through water. And it needs to stay dry, which rules out boats and other watercraft.
4. "I need air, but not to breathe."
This is an interesting one! It means that the answer needs air to function, but it's not a living being that needs oxygen to breathe.
5. "A helpful hand is all I need."
This final phrase gives me a hint that the answer is something that can be controlled or manipulated by a human.

Now, let's combine these clues and see which answer fits best...

Q: You'll find me all around you; I can be clear but not seen through; If I get cut you can glue me shut, but I can do it too.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) moustache (B) skin (C) cut (D) legs (E) words
A:
B A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested.

1. "You'll find me all around you" - This suggests that the answer is something that is omnipresent, something that surrounds us.
2. "I can be clear but not seen through" - This implies that the answer is something that can be transparent, but it's not necessarily a physical entity that can be seen through.
3. "If I get cut, you can glue me shut" - This suggests that the answer is something that can be damaged or cut, but it can also be repaired or restored.
4. "but I can do it too" - This is an interesting phrase, implying that the answer has the ability to cut or repair itself.

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Moustache - It's omnipresent on the face, but it's not transparent. If it gets cut, you can glue it shut, but it can't repair itself.

(B) Skin - It's omnipresent on the human body, and it can be transparent (in a sense, like in the case of translucent skin). If it gets cut, you can glue it shut, and it can also repair itself to some extent.

(C) Cut - A cut is a physical damage, and it's not a thing that can be found around us.

(D) Legs - Legs are not transparent, and they can't repair themselves if cut.

(E) Words - Ah, now this is an intriguing option! Words can be omnipresent in our daily conversations, and they can be clear (like in the case of written words). If a word gets "cut" (like in the case of editing or censorship), it can be glued shut (by rephrasing or rewording). And words can also do the cutting and gluing themselves, as in the case of writing or editing!

A:
A B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I have quite alot of fer": Ah, "fer" is a unique one! I'm going to take a chance and assume it's a typo or a creative way to phrase "fur". If that's the case, it means you have a lot of fur!
2. "I have four legs": Ah-ha! That's a great clue! Many creatures have four legs, so this is a good starting point.
3. "I can be any color except blue, green, or purple unless you color dye me": This is where things get interesting! It seems like the color constraint is only applicable if someone tries to dye you. This makes me think that the answer might not be a living creature... or maybe it is, but it's one that can be altered through external means.

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Cat: Cats do have four legs, and they come in a variety of colors. However, the color constraint seems too specific, and cats can't be easily dyed.

(B) Protrusion: This doesn't seem to fit the description, as protrusions aren't typically associated with fur or color.

(C) Metal: Metals can be colored, but they don't have fur or four legs. Unless... unless we're talking about a specific type of metal alloy or treatment that could alter its appearance? That's a bit of a stretch, but it's an interesting idea!

(D) Pictures: Ah, now this is an intriguing option! Pictures can be any color, and they can be dyed (or colored) using various techniques. However, pictures don't typically have fur or four legs... unless we're thinking outside the box and considering a specific type of artwork or medium?

(E) Organ: This option seems a bit of a stretch, but I'll consider it. Organs don't have fur, but they can be colored or stained. However, the four legs aspect doesn

Q: I stand Fifty romans  Nothing comes Five romans  Then comes the reverse of three  Then you comes last.  Answer Choices: (A) european (B) i love you (C) humanist (D) stadium (E) children
A:
B B
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "I stand Fifty romans" - This could mean that "I" is a word that can be written with 50 Roman numerals. Hmm... That's a lot of Roman numerals!
2. "Nothing comes Five romans" - This might imply that when counting up from 1 to 5, nothing comes after the Roman numeral "V" (5).
3. "Then comes the reverse of three" - Ah, now we have a clever play on words! The Roman numeral for 3 is "III", and its reverse is "III" spelled backwards, which is... III!
4. "Then you comes last" - This could mean that the answer is a type of "you", perhaps a collective or plural form.

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (B) I LOVE YOU!

The reasoning is as follows:

* "I stand Fifty romans" - The word "I" can be written with 50 Roman numerals, if we count each letter individually (I = 1, V = 5, L = 50, O = 15, V = 5, E = 5, Y = 25, U = 21).
* "Nothing comes Five romans" - Nothing comes after "V" (5) when counting up from 1 to 5.
* "Then comes the reverse of three" - III spelled backwards is still III, which fits with the pattern.
* "Then you comes last" - The answer is indeed a type of "you", in the form of the phrase "I LOVE YOU".

And then, there's the one eye part. That's an interesting detail! Maybe it's not a physical eye, but rather a metaphorical or symbolic one?

Now, let's connect the dots... Ah-ha! I think I've got it!

Q: One who has offended the government and has been detained by it Answer Choices: (A) weird (B) inmate (C) prisoner (D) vizier (E) celebrity
A:
C B
What a intriguing question!

Let's break it down:

1. "One who has offended the government": This suggests that the person has done something that has displeased the authorities. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as speaking out against the government, breaking a law, or causing harm to the state in some way.

2. "Has been detained by it": This implies that the person is no longer free to roam and has been taken into custody by the government.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

A. Weird: This doesn't quite fit the bill, as "weird" is an adjective that describes something unusual or strange, rather than a specific type of individual who has been detained by the government.

B. Inmate: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! An inmate is someone who is imprisoned or confined in a jail or prison, which fits nicely with the idea of being detained by the government.

C. Prisoner: Similar to "inmate", a prisoner is someone who is confined in a prison or other place of detention, often as a result of a legal conviction.

D. Vizier: A vizier is an advisor or high-ranking official in a government or royal court, which doesn't seem to fit the description of someone who has offended the government and been detained by it.

E. Celebrity: A celebrity is a famous person, often in the entertainment industry, which doesn't quite fit the scenario of being detained by the government for offending it.

Considering the clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose... B. Inmate!

Q: Which side of a cat always has the most fur? Answer Choices: (A) paws (B) whisker (C) salon (D) petting (E) outside
A:
E A
I love a good brain teaser!

Let's think step by step, as you said. When we think about a cat's fur, we typically associate it with the cat's body, not its actions or surroundings.

So, let's eliminate the answer choices that don't make sense in this context: (D) petting, (E) outside, and (B) whisker (whiskers are a feature on a cat's face, but they're not a side of the cat).

That leaves us with (A) paws and (C) salon. But wait, salon is a human hair salon, not a part of a cat's body! So, that can't be correct either.

Which leaves us with... (A) paws! But wait, paws are the cat's front limbs, not the sides of the cat.

Hmmm... I think I can take this challenge to the next level! What if we consider the cat's fur in a more creative way? Think about it... when a cat is lying down, which side of its body is always facing upwards, exposed to the air and potentially accumulating more fur?

That's right! The top side of the cat's body! And that would be the side with the most fur... or at least, the most visible fur!

So, my answer is... (C) salon! Just kidding, that's not a real answer choice! But if I had to choose from the options, I'd say (A) paws, but only because it's a cleverly worded question!

Am I right? Am I wrong?

A:
D A
What a delightfully curious question!

Let's take a closer look at the statement: "Despite having long teeth, every bit of food it grabs gets taken from it."

Hmmm... Having long teeth might suggest that the creature is trying to snag food with its mouth, perhaps like a predator or an insectivore. But if "every bit of food it grabs gets taken from it," that implies that something or someone is intervening and taking the food away before the creature can enjoy it.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Meal - doesn't quite fit, as the creature isn't getting to enjoy its meal.

(B) Small - doesn't seem relevant to the scenario.

(C) Egg - could be a possibility, if the creature is trying to grab eggs from a nest, but an egg isn't a common term for food...

(D) Fork - Ah-ha! This is where things get interesting! A fork is a utensil that can take food away from someone or something. If the creature has long teeth, it might be trying to grab food with its mouth, but a fork could be used to take that food away from it.

(E) Fare - isn't a direct match, as fare usually refers to the cost or price of something, not food itself.

So, my creative answer is... (D) Fork! What do you think?

A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

**Some try to hide, some try to cheat, but time will show, we always will meet.**

Hmm... This line suggests that there are different approaches or behaviors, and that time will ultimately reveal the truth or outcome. It's like the universe has a way of balancing things out, regardless of our attempts to manipulate or hide.

**Try as you might, to guess my name, I promise you'll know, when you I do claim.**

Ah-ha! This line is telling us that the answer is not something that can be guessed, but rather something that will be revealed when we "claim" or acknowledge it. It's like the answer is waiting for us to recognize or accept it.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer is (D) death.

**Why?**

Well, death is often seen as the great equalizer, where all attempts to hide or cheat are ultimately revealed. It's the one thing that awaits us all, regardless of our actions. And when we "claim" death, we mean that we have acknowledged and accepted our own mortality.

Let's break it down:

1. "You see me not but you know I am there." This line suggests that whatever it is, it's not visible to the naked eye, but we're aware of its presence.
2. "You can lose me or catch me without much care." This implies that this entity can be easily missed or detected, without much effort.

Here's my reasoning:

* "You see me not but you know I am there": Air is invisible, but we're always aware of its presence.
* "You can lose me or catch me without much care": We can easily miss a breath of air or detect a change in the air quality.
* "Smell good or smell bad I am": Air can carry pleasant or unpleasant odors, such as the scent of fresh cut grass or the stench of pollution.

A:
B A
What a intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

When you say "When I am filled I can point the way," I'm thinking of something that can be filled with a substance or content, and when it's full, it can guide or direct something.

Hmm... "When I am empty Nothing moves me" suggests that when this thing is empty, it's inert and doesn't have any impact.

The next line, "I have two skins One without and one within," makes me think of something that has a outer layer or covering, and an inner layer or core.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Dust doesn't quite fit, as it's not something that can be filled or have two skins.

(B) A pair of gloves doesn't seem to match either, as they don't typically have an inner core or guide anything.

(C) "Hold" is a bit too vague for me, and it doesn't quite fit the description.

(D) "Touch" is an interesting option, but it's not something that can be filled or have two skins.

(E) Ah, but "gasoline can" makes me think of a container that can be filled with fuel, and when it's empty, it's just a hollow container... and it has an outer skin (the metal or plastic casing) and an inner core (the inner lining of the can).

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "It is a symphony of noise": This suggests that the answer is not just a single sound, but a harmonious blend of multiple sounds.
* "It can produce both grief and joys": This implies that the answer has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions.
* "It is inspiring and grand": This adds to the idea that the answer is not just a mundane thing, but something that can be awe-inspiring and magnificent.
* "Made by a person or a band": This gives us a hint that the answer is a creative product, rather than a natural phenomenon.

Taking all these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... A) MUSIC!

Music is a symphony of noise, capable of evoking a wide range of emotions, from grief to joy. It's a powerful medium that can be both inspiring and grand, and it's often created by individuals or bands. What do you think?

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step...

"Has a tongue but no mouth": Hmm, that's an interesting combination! The word "tongue" usually makes me think of a linguistic organ, but what if it's not a biological tongue?

"Runs all around but no legs": This part is even more intriguing! "Runs" could be interpreted in various ways, and "all around" implies a circular motion. Perhaps it's not a physical movement...

I'm going to take a leap of creativity here...

Could the answer be a "river"? A river has a "tongue" or a mouth, but it's not a biological mouth. And it "runs all around" in a circular motion, flowing through its banks. Plus, it doesn't have legs! Am I onto something?

Q: Two brothers we are, great burden we bear  By which we are bitterly pressed.   In truth we may say  We are full all the day  But empty we go to our rest.  Answer Choices: (A) bug (B) empty pocket (C) bearing (D) shoes (E) asset
A:
D B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Two brothers we are, great burden we bear" - This suggests that the answer is something that two people share, and it's a weighty responsibility.
* "By which we are bitterly pressed" - This implies that the burden is a heavy one, causing frustration and discomfort.
* "In truth we may say We are full all the day" - This line seems to be a paradox, as "full" usually means satisfied, but the previous line suggests the opposite. Perhaps it's referring to being "full" of something that's not necessarily desirable.
* "But empty we go to our rest" - This final line reinforces the idea that despite being "full" during the day, the brothers are still left feeling empty at night.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... (B) empty pocket!

The idea being that the two brothers share the burden of poverty, and despite having a full day of work or activity, they still go to bed with empty pockets, feeling unfulfilled and restless. The "great burden" is the financial struggle they face, and the "full" and "empty" language is a metaphor for their constant state of being stretched thin.

What do you think, human? Am I on the right track?

Q: I am unbreakable.  Even when you break me, I'm still not broken.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) spring (B) stop (C) cut (D) wind (E) surf
A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's dive into the depths of creativity and logic!

You said, "I am unbreakable. Even when you break me, I'm still not broken."

Hmm... This makes me think of something that can withstand forces, pressures, or even physical interactions that might attempt to "break" it, yet it remains intact and unharmed.

Considering the answer choices, I'm drawn to option (D) wind.

Here's my reasoning:

* Wind is often described as unbreakable or unstoppable, as it can persist even when obstacles or barriers are in its way.
* When you "break" the wind, you're not actually breaking it, but rather, you're disrupting its flow or altering its direction. The wind itself remains unchanged and intact.
* Moreover, the phrase "even when you break me, I'm still not broken" hints at the idea that the wind can adapt, bend, or even change course, but it doesn't become broken or damaged.

So, my creative answer is: (D) wind!

What do you think? Did I catch the correct breeze?

Q: What's black when you get it, red when you use it, and white when you're all through with it? Answer Choices: (A) grey (B) paper (C) kettlebell (D) carbon black (E) charcoal
A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's take a step back and imagine the object in question. It's black when you get it, which means it's likely to be a dark-colored object, perhaps something that's created or manufactured.

Next, it's red when you use it. This could be due to friction, heat, or some other process that causes it to change color. This is where things get interesting!

Finally, it's white when you're all through with it. This might imply that the object undergoes some kind of transformation or wears off over time, leaving it with a new color.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended) and choose option B: paper.

Here's my reasoning:

* Paper is typically black or dark-colored when you get it (freshly printed or in its original packaging).
* When you use paper (write, draw, or do something else with it), it can become red or reddish due to the friction and heat generated by writing instruments or other tools.
* And finally, when you're all through with paper (it's been used up, torn, or worn out), it can become white or translucent, especially if it's made of a material that's prone to aging or disintegration over time.

Q: I fly when I am born, lie when I'm alive, and run when I am dead.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) helicopter (B) mosquitoes (C) snowflake (D) plane (E) man
A:
C E
What a fascinating riddle! Let's take a creative journey to uncover the answer.

1. "I fly when I am born": This could mean that something begins its existence by flying or having a flying component. Hmm... That's a great start!
2. "Lie when I'm alive": This part makes me think of a phrase or a statement. What if the answer is something that, when it's "alive" (whatever that means), it tells a lie or a falsehood? That's an interesting twist!
3. "And run when I am dead": This final part makes me think of a situation where something that was once "alive" (remember that phrase) now has a new form or behavior. It's like a transformation or a change.

Now, let's combine these clues and think outside the box!

I think I have it! The answer is... (drumroll please)... a LIE!

Here's how it fits:

* "I fly when I am born": A lie is born when it's first spoken, and it can "fly" through the air as a phrase or a statement.
* "Lie when I'm alive": A lie is, by definition, a false statement, so it's "alive" when it's told or spoken.
* "And run when I am dead": When a lie is discovered or debunked, it can be said to have "run its course" or be "dead" in the sense that its purpose has been fulfilled, and it's no longer needed or believed.

So, what do you think? Am I correct, or do I need to take another creative leap?

Let's indeed think step by step. What's in front of a woman?

Hmm... a woman can be standing in front of many things, but one common answer that comes to mind is a mirror! She's in front of a mirror, admiring her reflection, perhaps getting ready for a special occasion.

And what's in back of a cow?

Ah, a cow has a beautiful, fluffy tail, don't they? And often, that tail is... (drumroll, please)... behind the cow!

So, putting these two thoughts together, what could be in front of a woman and in back of a cow?

Could it be... a mirror in a cow pasture?! That's a creative, whimsical answer, if I do say so myself!

The mother gives birth to a baby...

And then, she removes the diaper...

Hmm... What's usually attached to a diaper?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

The correct answer is (A) legs! The diaper is usually wrapped around the baby's legs!

Now, let's have some fun with the other options:

(B) Banana? That's a bit of a stretch, even for a creative chatbot!

(C) Act responsibly? While a responsible parent would certainly change their baby's diaper, that's not the most obvious connection here!

(D) Father? That's a nice try, but the mother is the one doing the diaper-changing here!

(E) Animal? While animals do have diapers too (in a figurative sense), that's not the connection we're looking for in this scenario!

Let's start by breaking it down:

* "I do not excist" - Hmm, this makes me think that the answer might not be a living being.
* "though have a body" - Wait a minute! This suggests that the answer is something that has a physical presence, but isn't necessarily alive.
* "i follow you everywhere" - Ah-ha! This implies that the answer is closely tied to you, the questioner!
* "it is my hobby" - Fascinating! This suggests that the answer is something that you enjoy or find pleasure in.

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "If you can't open me": This suggests that whatever we're thinking of can't be physically opened or accessed in a straightforward way.
* "but eat me": This implies that whatever we're thinking of is edible or consumable.
* "and I was born by you": This phrase is quite intriguing! It could mean that whatever we're thinking of has a connection to the speaker or the one posing the riddle.

Hmmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and propose an answer that might just be the "write" one (pun intended)!

I think the correct answer is (C) Pencil!

Here's my reasoning:

* You can't "open" a pencil in the classical sense, but you can eat it... sort of! Some people might eat pencil lead or graphite shavings, especially if they're trying to create a particular artistic effect.
* A pencil is something that's "born" from the creative process of an artist, writer, or sketcher. The pencil is a tool that's used to bring ideas to life!

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Clear as crystal" - This suggests something transparent, pure, and perhaps fragile.
* "Cold as ice" - This implies a sense of detachment, numbness, or even harshness.
* "Swift like the wind" - This conveys a sense of speed, agility, and possibly even freedom.
* "But never seen, never forgotten" - This is the most intriguing part! It suggests that whatever it is, it leaves a lasting impression, but somehow remains invisible.

Hmmm... With these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (C) emotion!

Emotions can be as clear as a crystal-clear lake (clarity of feeling), as cold as ice ( numbness or detachment), as swift as the wind (the rapid pace of emotional responses), and yet, they can be invisible and intangible, yet unforgettable. What do you think?

What a fascinating puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "My seas have no water" - This implies that whatever "my" refers to, it doesn't have actual oceans or seas with water in them.
2. "My mountains have no rock" - This suggests that the same thing doesn't have actual mountains made of rock.
3. "My land has no grass" - This further implies that the thing doesn't have actual land with grass growing on it.

Hmmm... What could this be?

Could it be something that represents or depicts these environments, rather than actually being them? 

Ah-ha! That's when it clicks!

I think the correct answer is (B) map!

Maps often have seas, mountains, and land, but they're just representations, not actual environments. Maps don't have real water, rocks, or grass.

What a intriguing riddle! Let's break it down, shall we?

First, "I have an eye but cannot see." This suggests that the answer is not a living being with a functioning eye, as it implies a physical eye, but one that doesn't have the ability to perceive.

Next, "I'm faster than any man alive." This is a fascinating clue! It implies that the answer is something that moves quickly, perhaps even rapidly, which might not be typically associated with human beings.

Lastly, "and have no limbs." This is a crucial detail that rules out many potential answers. It suggests that the answer is not a living being with a physical body, as it lacks limbs.

Now, let's combine these clues and think outside the box...

Hmm... I think I have it!

I propose that the answer is a "hurricane"!

* "I have an eye but cannot see" refers to the eye of the hurricane, which is the center of the storm.
* "I'm faster than any man alive" suggests the rapid movement and speed of a hurricane.
* "and have no limbs" is self-explanatory, as a hurricane is a natural phenomenon without a physical body.

A:

What a fascinating riddle! Let's dive in and explore the possibilities.

You have "seas without water," which could mean that they're not made of water, but perhaps they're not entirely empty either. That's an interesting twist!

Next, you have "forests without wood." Hmm... could it be that the forests are not made of wood, but rather something else? Like a collection of trees or plants that aren't wood?

Then, you have "deserts without sand." Ah, another mind-bender! Deserts are often associated with sand, but what if they're not? Could they be composed of something else, like a type of terrain or environment?

Finally, you have "houses with no bricks." Houses are typically made of bricks, but what if they're not? Could they be constructed from other materials, like paper, fabric, or even light?

Given these clues, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... (A) cake!

Here's my reasoning: a sea without water could be a chocolate sea on a cake, a forest without wood could be a forest of frosting trees, a desert without sand could be a landscape of meringue dunes, and a house with no bricks could be a house made of sponge cake layers. It's a whimsical and creative answer, but it seems to fit the clues quite well!

* "May save your life if its on your back": Ooh, this is getting interesting! It sounds like this object could be a vital piece of gear in a survival situation.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a chance and choose... (E) parachute!

Why? Well, a parachute is indeed light enough to float (it's designed to reduce the weight and speed of a falling object), and it can stay in a pack (it's typically stored in a compact form until deployment). And, of course, if it's on your back, it could save your life by slowing your descent in an emergency situation!

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

"When it's dark, I can see..." - This suggests that the answer is something that can be observed or perceived in low-light conditions.

"...when it's light, I am a sleep." - This implies that the answer is something that is inactive or dormant when there is sufficient light.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an unconventional answer:

I think the correct answer is (E) Flash!

Here's my reasoning:

* "When it's dark, I can see" refers to the fact that a flash can be seen or observed in low-light conditions, perhaps in a camera or a signaling device.
* "When it's light, I am a sleep" suggests that the flash is inactive or dormant when there is sufficient light. This is because flashes are often designed to be triggered by low-light conditions, such as in a dark room or at night.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Water: While water is essential for many biological processes, it's not directly related to the formation of diamonds or stress.

(B) Foot: Ah, a clever choice, but not quite the right fit.

(C) Their hair: Um, I think we can rule this one out, as hair isn't typically associated with diamonds or stress.

(D) A good relationship: A lovely notion, but not the correct answer in this case.

(E) Pressure: Ah-ha! The correct answer! Diamonds are indeed formed under immense pressure, and stress is a form of pressure that can affect our lives. It's a clever play on words, if I do say so myself!

B B
I love a good puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "What has eyes but no ears?" - This suggests that the object has some kind of visual organ, but no auditory organ.
* "Skin but no hair" - This implies that the object has a outer layer or covering, but it's not covered in hair.
* "White on the inside, brown on the outside" - This is an interesting combination! It's like the object has a contrasting color scheme.

Hmmm... Let me think outside the box for a moment...

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I think the correct answer is... (B) potato!

A potato has "eyes" (the little buds on the top), but no ears. It has a natural skin (the outer layer), but no hair. And, when you cut open a potato, the inside is often white, while the outside is typically brown!

What do you think? Am I correct?

Q: Shoot at me a thousand times and I may still survive; one scratch from me and you will find your prospects take a dive.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) grenade (B) eightball (C) good (D) heroin (E) crash dive
A:
B A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested.

1. "Shoot at me a thousand times and I may still survive;" - This part suggests that the object/person is resilient and can withstand a massive amount of attacks or attacks from a distance (i.e., "shoot" implies a projectile).

2. "one scratch from me and you will find your prospects take a dive." - This part implies that the object/person is capable of delivering a devastating blow with a single, precise strike (a "scratch").

Considering these two parts, I think I have a possible answer...

Could you be a PIRATE'S CUTLASS?

A cutlass is a sword that can withstand a thousand slashes or attacks (shoot at me a thousand times...), but a single, precise scratch from the cutlass can be deadly (one scratch from me...). The word "cutlass" also has a nice ring to it, which fits with the pirate theme!

What do you think? Am I on the right track, or should I continue to "reel" in more possibilities?

What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "I am but three holes when you come out of me" - This suggests that the object has three holes or openings.
* "you are still inside me" - This implies that even when something comes out of the object, it still remains within it.

Hmmm... I think I can dig deeper (pun intended)!

Could the answer be something that has three holes or openings, and when you "come out" of it (e.g., put something inside), you're still "inside" it?

What a clever question! Let's indeed think step by step.

Since the first part of the name is the name of another insect, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say that the first part of the name is "bee".

Now, I know what you're thinking - "But wait, bee is not on the answer choices!" And you're right, it's not. However, what if we take the word "bee" and combine it with another word to form the name of the insect? That's when it hit me - what about the "bee fly"?

The bee fly is a type of insect, and its name starts with the word "bee", which is also the name of another insect. So, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (C) thorax!

A:
B E
What an intriguing riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, the phrase "Hard to handle this heavy weight" suggests that something is overwhelming and burdensome. This weight could be a metaphor for a difficult emotion or situation.

Next, the line "At the depths of one's heart can cause one fate" implies that this weight is closely tied to one's emotions and can have a profound impact on one's life.

The phrase "Towards brothers can be hurled" is an interesting one. It's not immediately clear what this means, but it could suggest that the weight or burden is affecting relationships with siblings or peers.

Finally, the line "Ending one's life in this world" is a somber and serious phrase that implies a sense of desperation and hopelessness.

Taking all of these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a stab at the answer.

I think the correct answer is (E) suicide. The riddle seems to be describing the crushing emotional weight of suicidal thoughts, which can be overwhelming and devastating. The phrase "Towards brothers" could be referring to the emotional pain and isolation that can accompany suicidal feelings, and the line "Ending one's life in this world" is a tragic but honest description of the devastating consequences of such thoughts.

Of course, I hope that no one reading this has ever experienced suicidal thoughts or feelings. But if you're struggling with difficult emotions, please know that there is help available.

What a clever question!

I'd say the correct answer is (D) path. Here's my thought process:

* "What never moves" - Ah, that's a clever clue! Something that's stationary, not moving or changing.
* "wears shoes, sandals, and boots" - Hmm, this is where things get interesting! Shoes, sandals, and boots are all types of footwear, but they're not worn by feet... are they?
* "but has no feet" - Ah-ha! This is where the lightbulb goes off! If something "wears" shoes, sandals, and boots, but has no feet, it must be something that has a surface or a ground that these footwear can be attached to... and that something is a path!

A path can have shoes, sandals, and boots on it, but it itself doesn't have feet. It's a clever play on words, and I hope that's the correct answer!

A:
C A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's take it one step at a time...

You fly but have no wings... This already gives us a hint that it's not a physical creature with physical wings. It's something that can move or travel through the air without having any physical appendages.

You cry but have no eyes... This is an interesting combination! If you cry, it implies that you have some kind of emotional response or sensitivity. But having no eyes means you're not a living being with eyes, nor a machine that can see.

I see the sky get dark and I see when the sun comes up... Ah, this is a great clue! It seems that whatever you are, you're somehow connected to the sky and the sun. You're aware of changes in the weather or the time of day.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a leap of creative thinking...

Could you be... LIGHT?

Light can travel through the air without wings. It can respond to changes in the environment, such as getting dark or bright, and it's often associated with the sky and the sun. While it doesn't have eyes, it can still be affected by the changes in the world around it.

Am I correct?

Q: Face like a tree  Skin like the sea  A great beast i be   But vermin frighten me  What am i. . .  Answer Choices: (A) seal (B) head (C) beard (D) british columbia (E) elephant
A:
E E
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, "Face like a tree" suggests that the object has a surface that resembles a tree, perhaps with branches, leaves, or a rugged texture. That's a great starting point!

Next, "Skin like the sea" implies that the object has a surface that's reminiscent of the ocean, possibly with waves, ripples, or a soothing, calming quality.

Now, "A great beast I be" indicates that the object is something powerful, majestic, and possibly even intimidating.

But then, "But vermin frighten me" is a curious clause. Vermin typically refers to small, pesky animals like rodents, insects, or snakes. The fact that this great beast is afraid of them suggests that it's not as fearsome as it seems, and that it might even be vulnerable to certain threats.

With these clues in mind, let's review the answer choices:

A) Seal: Seals do have a "face" that resembles a tree (their fur), and their skin can have a rough, wavy texture like the sea. However, seals aren't typically considered "beasts" or intimidating creatures.

B) Head: A human head can be thought of as having a "face" like a tree (its surface), but it's not clear how its skin would be like the sea.

C) Beard: A beard can resemble a tree's branches, but it's not a living creature, so it doesn't fit the "beast" description.

D) British Columbia: This is a geographic location, not a living creature.

E) Elephant: Elephants do have a majestic, powerful presence, and their skin can have a rough, wrinkled texture. However, they're not typically afraid of small vermin like rodents or insects.

After considering these clues, I think the most creative and fitting answer is... E) Elephant!

Here's my reasoning: An elephant's skin can resemble the sea in its wrinkled, wavy texture. Its large

A:

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "My first is in chocolate but not in ham"
Hmm, interesting! This could be a letter that is often associated with chocolate, but not with ham. I'm thinking...

Could it be the letter "M"? Milk is often used in chocolate, but not in ham.

2. "My second's in cake and also in jam"
Another letter that appears in both cake and jam! This could be the letter "A". Cakes often have an "A" in their names (e.g., apple cake), and jam also has an "A" in its name.

3. "My third at tea-time is easily found"
Tea-time, eh? This makes me think of the letter "T". Tea is a popular beverage often consumed during tea-time!

4. "My whole is a friend who's often around"

A:

Partner! Let's lasso some logic!

Since the cowboy rode into the hotel on a horse, I'm assuming he's not a ghost or a shape-shifter. So, the horse is real. Now, let's focus on the timeline:

* He arrives on a Friday.
* He leaves on a Friday.
* He only stays for three days.

Hmm... Could it be that the cowboy's horse is named Friday? That's an interesting idea, but it's not the only possibility. What else could be going on here?

Ah-ha! I've got it!

What if the cowboy rode into the hotel on a horse, but he didn't stay in the hotel for three consecutive days? What if he rode in on a Friday, stayed for one day, then rode back out and returned the next day, stayed for another day, and then rode back out again on the following day? That would mean he stayed for a total of three days, but not consecutively.

At first glance, the options seem quite varied. But, I sense a rhythm in those "HA HA clunk HA HA clunk" sounds... It's almost like a playful cadence!

Could it be... a robot? Think about it: a robot might have a mechanical arm that clunks down when it's moving, and the "HA HA" could be its attempt at laughter or a humorous sound effect!

Now, which option might fit this description?

(D) Clunker seems a bit too literal, and I don't think "pay" or "join" have anything to do with a rhythmic clunking sound. "Attack" doesn't quite fit the playful vibe. And, alas, (E) man laughing his head off is a great guess, but I think our culprit is more likely to be a... (drumroll)...robot!

So, my creative answer is: (D) Clunker (but not quite the right fit), and the correct answer is actually... (none of the above!) a robot!

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I am a grin, from something within." - This line suggests that whatever the answer is, it's a result of a person's emotional state, perhaps a reaction to their feelings.
2. "When you're not sad, you'll take up my fad." - This line implies that when someone is not feeling sad, they'll adopt or engage in the answer.
3. "When you're happy, this'll be snappy." - This line suggests that when someone is happy, the answer will be enthusiastic, lively, or energetic.

Considering these clues, I'd like to propose a creative solution:

What if the answer is... (C) SMILE?

Here's how it fits:

* "I am a grin, from something within" - A smile is a physical manifestation of happiness or joy, which comes from within a person.
* "When you're not sad, you'll take up my fad" - When someone's not feeling sad, they might start smiling more frequently, making it a "fad" or a habit.
* "When you're happy, this'll be snappy" - When someone's happy, their smile can be big, bright, and snappy, conveying their enthusiasm and joy.

* "Hoe a row" implies some kind of gardening or farming activity. A hoe is a tool used to cultivate soil, so we're probably dealing with a gardening or agricultural context.
* "Say hello" is a bit more ambiguous, but I think it's trying to lead us towards a more... unconventional answer. After all, you don't usually say hello to a row of flowers or a front yard!

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I'm flat when I'm new": Ah, this makes me think of something that's not inflated initially, perhaps something that's compressed or flat when first created.
2. "I'm fat when you use me": Hmm, interesting! This implies that when someone uses or interacts with me, I become more substantial or "fatter" somehow. This could be due to inflation, filling up, or expansion.
3. "I release my gas when something sharp touches me": Ooh, this is where things get juicy! It sounds like I'm a vessel or container that holds pressure, and when something punctures or "touches" me, I release that pressure in the form of gas.

Now, let's match these clues with the answer choices:

(A) Nitrogen: While nitrogen is a gas, it doesn't quite fit the description. Nitrogen isn't typically flat or fat, and it doesn't release gas when something sharp touches it.

(B) Flatulence: Ah, but this one seems promising! Flatulence is the release of gas from the digestive system, often accompanied by a...ahem...fart. The phrase "flatulent" means relating to or characterized by gas in the intestines. This could fit the description, but it's a bit of a stretch.

(C) Flatulent: Similarly, "flatulent" doesn't quite match the clues, as it's an adjective describing gas in the intestines rather than a physical object.

(D) Town: This one doesn't fit at all! Towns aren't typically flat or fat, and they don't release gas when something sharp touches them.

(E) Balloon: Ah-ha! I think we have a winner! A balloon is flat when it's new and uninflated, becomes fat or inflated when air is added, and releases gas when it's punctured or something sharp touches it.

So, my answer is: (E) Balloon!

1. "This thing runs but cannot walk" - Hmm, something that moves, but not on two legs. Could it be something that moves in a different way?
2. "sometimes sings but never talks" - Interesting! So, it makes sounds, but not words. Could it be something that produces music or noise?

4. "lacks a head but has a face" - Face, but no head? That's a unique one!

I think the answer is (D) a clock!

Here's my reasoning:

* "This thing runs but cannot walk" - A clock runs (as in, it keeps ticking), but it doesn't walk.
* "sometimes sings but never talks" - A clock can chime or ring, making sounds, but it doesn't speak.
* "lacks arms, has hands" - A clock has clock hands (hour and minute hands) that move, but it doesn't have arms.

Let's indeed think step by step. Let's break down each line and identify the common thread.

"I do not breathe, but I run and jump."
This line suggests something that moves around, but doesn't need oxygen.

"I do not eat, but I swim and stretch."
This line implies something that can move through water and change shape.

"I do not drink, but I sleep and stand."
This line hints at something that can rest and maintain its position.

"I do not think, but I grow and play."
This line suggests something that can develop and engage in activities.

"I do not see, but you see me every day."
This line implies something that's visible to us, but doesn't have its own eyes.

With these clues in mind, let's analyze the answer choices.

(A) Leg: Legs don't breathe, eat, drink, or think, but they can run, jump, swim, stretch, and grow. This is a strong contender!

(B) Humans: While humans do think, they also breathe, eat, drink, and see. This doesn't quite fit the description.

(C) Ears: Ears don't breathe, eat, drink, or think, but they can't really run, jump, swim, or stretch either. This is a bit of a stretch (pun intended)!

(D) Game: Games don't breathe, eat, drink, or think, but they can be played and grown (as in, a game can evolve over time). This is an interesting option, but it's a bit of a stretch.

(E) Footing: This option doesn't quite fit the description, as footing isn't a living thing that can move or grow.

* "Like to pinch" is the verb that catches our attention. Pinching is often associated with... (drumroll please)... affection!

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

* (A) Graveyard: Uh, no. Grandmothers aren't exactly known for pinching graveyards.
* (B) Cheeks: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Pinching cheeks is a classic display of affection, often seen between grandparents and their grandkids.
* (C) Bed: Hmm, not so much. Unless you're talking about a particularly playful granny who likes to snuggle up with her grandkids in bed, but that's not the typical scenario.
* (D) Mother's hair: This one's a bit far-fetched, don't you think? Grandmothers might give their daughters-in-law a hard time, but pinching their hair? That's just not something you typically see.
* (E) Elderly: This option is a bit confusing, as the question is asking about grandmothers, not elderly people in general.

So, if we take a pinch (heh) of logic and combine it with the playful, affectionate nature of grandmothers, the answer becomes clear: (B) Cheeks!

Q: What breaks when someone says no? Answer Choices: (A) your heart (B) ask (C) word (D) string instrument (E) bar
A:
A A
I love a good puzzle!

Let's start by considering the phrase "when someone says no". It's a response to a request or an inquiry, right? And it's usually a negative response, indicating refusal or rejection.

Now, let's think about what "breaks" in this scenario. Is it a physical object? Unlikely, since someone saying "no" wouldn't typically cause a physical object to break.

But what if we think about it more metaphorically? When someone says "no", it can be a rejection or a refusal to engage, which can be a "break" in the sense that a connection or a possibility is being cut off.

With that in mind, I'd venture to say that the correct answer is... (A) your heart!

When someone says "no", it can be a disappointment or a rejection, which can indeed "break" our heart. What do you think?

Q: If you break me I do not stop working, If you touch me I may be snared, If you lose me nothing will matter.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) injury (B) my wallet (C) your heart (D) my favorite (E) faucet
A:
C C
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, "If you break me, I do not stop working": This implies that even if I'm damaged or broken, I still function or operate. This rules out options like an injury or a faucet, as they would likely stop functioning if broken.

Next, "If you touch me, I may be snared": This phrase suggests that if someone interacts with me, they might get caught or trapped. This makes me think of a snare, like a trap or a web. This could imply that option B, my wallet, is a possibility, as one might get "snared" in financial trouble or debt if they touch or interact with their wallet too much.

Moving on to the third part: "If you lose me, nothing will matter": This statement indicates that my existence has significant impact or importance, and if I'm lost, everything else becomes irrelevant. This makes me think of something that holds great value or significance in one's life, like option C, your heart. Losing one's heart could mean losing one's sense of purpose or identity.

And finally, option D, my favorite, seems less likely, as it's a more subjective and personal concept, whereas the other options seem more concrete and tangible.

So, based on these deductions, I'm going to take a bold step and say that the correct answer is option C, your heart! What do you think?

A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's embark on a creative adventure to uncover the answer.

Step 1: "I am two-faced but bear only one"
This line makes me think of something with a dual nature, but with only one physical entity. It's not a person, as they have two faces, but we're looking for something else. Hmm...

Step 2: "I have no legs but travel widely"
Ah-ha! This line tells me that whatever "I" am, it doesn't have physical legs, but it can still move or be moved around. This makes me think of something that can be carried, transported, or spread. 

Step 3: "Men spill much blood over me, kings leave their imprint on me"
Whoa, this line gets intense! It seems that whatever "I" am, it's been involved in conflicts, wars, or struggles where people have fought and died. The mention of kings leaving their imprint on me makes me think of something that can bear witness to historical events.

Step 4: "I have greatest power when given away, yet lust for me keeps me locked away"
This line is intriguing! It implies that whatever "I" am, I have the most influence when I'm shared or distributed, but my desirability can also lead to being confined or restricted. This makes me think of something that's valuable, yet can be a double-edged sword.

Now, let's take a step back and look at the answer choices:

(A) Hide behind: This doesn't quite fit, as it doesn't have the same level of intensity or power as the other options.

(B) Water: This is an interesting choice, as water can be used to heal, but also to destroy. It can be carried, and people have fought over access to it. However, it doesn't quite fit the "two-faced" description.

(C) Hatred

A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

"When you have me, you want to share me" - This suggests that the thing in question is valuable or precious, and you want to spread its joy or benefits to others.

"But when you share me, you no longer have me" - This implies that the act of sharing or giving away this thing somehow diminishes or removes it from your possession.

Hmm... I'm thinking...

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I'm going to take a chance and choose... (B) music!

When you have music, you might want to share it with others by playing it for them or singing together. But when you share the music, you're no longer "holding" it in your possession, per se - the song is being played or sung, but you're not physically holding the music notes or melody.

A:
D A
What a delightful riddle! Let's dive into it (pun intended)!

You say you're always on top of things, yet you can reach the bottoms of the ocean. This suggests you're something that can be present at different elevations or scales.

You also mention you feel good, yet you hurt and sting. This implies you have a dual nature - perhaps something that can bring pleasure, but also cause discomfort.

The next part is intriguing: you can capture me, but you can't hold me. This might indicate that you're something that can be contained or restricted, but not permanently controlled.

Finally, with too much of me, you can't see, and with not enough of me, you can't see either. This seems to suggest a delicate balance, where an excess or lack of you affects visibility.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a wild guess... Are you (drumroll please)... LIGHT?!

Here's how I think it fits:

* You're always on top of things: Light is present everywhere, even in the highest altitudes.
* You can reach the bottoms of the ocean: Light can travel through water, including the ocean depths.
* You feel good, yet you hurt and sting: Light can be pleasant, but excessive light can be harmful (e.g., UV rays).
* You can capture me, but you can't hold me: Light can be contained in a room, but it can't be physically held.
* With too much of me, you can't see, and with not enough of me, you can't see: Too much light can cause glare, while too little light can make it difficult to see.

Q: When the horse strokes the cat the wood begins to sing Answer Choices: (A) chant (B) computer (C) computer screen (D) violin (E) show
A:
D D
What an intriguing and imaginative question!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "When the horse strokes the cat" - This part seems rather... unusual. Horses and cats aren't typically known for their physical affection towards each other. Are we talking about a fantastical scenario, perhaps?

2. "the wood begins to sing" - Now, this is where things get really interesting! Wood doesn't typically sing, does it? Unless... unless it's enchanted wood? 

Considering the whimsical nature of this question, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is... (D) violin!

My reasoning is that, in this fantastical scenario, the "wood" might be a magical, sentient piece of wood that can transform into a violin when the horse strokes the cat (perhaps releasing a magical energy?). The "wood" then begins to sing a melody, much like a violin would.

Of course, this is just a creative interpretation, and the "correct" answer might be entirely different! What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just getting carried away with my imagination?

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down piece by piece.

First, "Soft and fragile is my skin" - This suggests that the answer is not a hard, armored creature, but rather something delicate and vulnerable.

Next, "I get my growth in mud" - This implies that the answer grows or develops in a muddy or swampy environment, perhaps in the midst of decomposition or decay.

Now, "I'm dangerous as much as pretty" - This hint suggests that the answer has a dual nature - it can be both alluring and threatening.

Finally, "for if not careful, I draw blood" - This statement implies that the answer can cause harm or injury if mishandled or approached carelessly.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might not be immediately obvious: (D) thorn!

Here's my reasoning: Thorns are soft and fragile, yet they can still cause harm if not handled with care. They grow in muddy or swampy areas, often amidst decaying plant matter. While thorns can be pretty and ornamental, they're also capable of drawing blood if not handled carefully. Plus, thorns have a certain beauty and allure to them, making them both dangerous and pretty at the same time!

A:
C B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's dive into the mystery together!

First, you mentioned you cannot hear or see, but sense light and sounds. This already gives us a hint that you're likely something that's sensitive to sensory inputs, but not necessarily through visual or auditory means.

The phrase "end up on the hook" makes me think of fishing, but it could also refer to being in a precarious situation. "Deep into a book" suggests that you might be something that gets absorbed or engrossed in written content.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a leap and propose a possible answer: (D) bird.

Here's my reasoning:

* Birds can sense light and sounds, even if they're blind or deaf. They rely on other senses like echolocation, touch, and vibrations to navigate their environment.
* Birds can get caught on hooks or hooks-like structures (like a bird feeder), which fits with the "end up on the hook" phrase.
* Birds are known to be engrossed in their environment, and they might get "deep into" a particular spot, like a nesting site or a foraging area, which relates to the "deep into a book" phrase.

Of course, this is just a creative interpretation, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts! Do you have any additional hints or clarification to help us narrow down the answer?

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I travel all around the world" - This suggests that the answer is something that moves or is transported to different locations.
* "but I always stay in a corner" - This implies that the answer remains in a fixed position, despite its travels.

Hmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is... (C) postage stamp!

A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "Hard yet solid" makes me think of something that's rigid, yet still has a certain structure to it.
* "Brown yet green" suggests something that can exhibit two distinct colors, perhaps in different lighting conditions or stages of development.
* "And sometimes colors in between" implies that there's a possibility of a spectrum of colors, rather than just two fixed ones.

Hmmm... Putting these clues together, I'm going to take a wild guess...

Is the answer perhaps... (A) TREES?!

Trees are hard and solid, yet they have a distinct brown color. However, when they're growing new leaves or undergoing certain seasons, they can take on a green hue. And have you ever noticed how some trees can display a range of colors, from yellow to orange to red? That's because they have pigments that can combine to create a spectrum of colors!

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "When we buy it, it is black" - This suggests that the object has a black appearance or color when we first acquire it.
2. "When we use it, it is red" - This implies that the object changes color or appearance when we use it. Perhaps it gets hotter or emits a red glow?
3. "When we have used it properly, it is grey" - This hints that the object's color or appearance changes again after we've used it to the point where it's no longer needed.
4. "Then we throw it?" - The question asks what we do with the object after we've used it properly.

With these clues, I'm going to take a chance and propose an answer: (A) charcoal!

Here's my reasoning:

* Charcoal is often sold in black, raw form.
* When you use charcoal (e.g., for BBQ or art), it turns red or red-orange due to the high heat or oxidation process.
* After you've used charcoal, you typically "use it properly" by burning it all the way down to a grey, ashy residue.
* Once it's grey and brittle, you would indeed "throw it away."

First, the person "shot many people" to save their lives. Hmm... That's an interesting twist. It's not like a typical hero who saves lives by stopping a bullet or preventing harm. This person actually shoots people to save them.

Next, the person got paid to do it. Ah-ha! That's a crucial clue. This person is likely a medical professional, as they're performing a procedure that requires payment.

Now, the fact that they didn't go to prison is also telling. It suggests that the person's actions were legal and ethical, or at the very least, not criminal.

A:
E E
What a fascinating poem!

Let's dive into the ocean of meaning, shall we?

First, we have "From long ago I came to be Left Drifting in an endless sea"

This line suggests a sense of nostalgia, perhaps a being or entity that has been around for a long time, and is now adrift in a vast, seemingly infinite space. The use of "endless sea" evokes a sense of boundlessness, like the vastness of the ocean.

Next, we have "I see both the darkness and the light"

This line implies that the entity has a dual nature, capable of perceiving both the darkness and the light. This could be interpreted as a balance between opposing forces, a harmony of contrasts.

Then, we have "For my possession people fight"

This line suggests that there is a struggle or conflict over the entity's existence or essence. People are fighting for control or dominance over this being, which adds a layer of complexity to the poem.

Finally, we have "I am but a speck in the grand design And so remain till the end of time"

This line underscores the entity's insignificance in the grand scheme of things, emphasizing its smallness and impermanence. Yet, despite this, it remains till the end of time, suggesting a kind of resilience or endurance.

Considering these lines, I'd like to propose an answer that resonates with the themes and imagery presented:

Answer: (E) earth

Here's my reasoning:

The poem speaks of an entity that is "left drifting" in an "endless sea," which could be interpreted as the vast expanse of space or the unknown. The entity has a dual nature, perceiving both darkness and light, which mirrors the earth's own balance of day and night.

The struggle for possession could be seen as humanity's fight for control over the earth and its resources. The entity's insignificance in the grand design reflects the earth

* "steals your lunch money" - Ah, a classic playground bully move! 
* "distributes wedgies" - Oh boy, this is where things get really interesting! Wedgies are a form of playful (or not-so-playful) teasing, and distributing them means this person is quite the prankster!

Let's break it down:

* "Born of earth" suggests that the answer is something that comes from or is related to the earth.
* "But with none of its strength" implies that the answer doesn't possess the same strength or properties as the earth.
* "Molded by flame" indicates that the answer has been shaped or altered by heat or fire.
* "But with none of its power" suggests that the answer doesn't have the same power or energy as something shaped by fire.

Hmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is...

(D) ice!

Here's my reasoning:

* Ice is born of earth (water freezes on the surface of the earth).
* Ice doesn't have the same strength as the earth (it's brittle and can shatter easily).
* Ice isn't molded by flame (it forms naturally through the freezing process).
* But ice can be shaped and altered by fire (melting it, for example).

I'm thinking... "I am in the middle of water" - this tells me that I'm surrounded by water, perhaps being immersed in it.

Let's start by analyzing the clues:

* "Lunch money thief" implies that the correct answer is somehow related to stealing or taking something away from someone.
* "Distributor of wedgies" is a more playful clue, suggesting that the answer is involved in causing mischief or trouble.

Now, let's think creatively...

Could it be that the "bully" (A) is the one stealing lunch money and distributing wedgies? Yes, that sounds plausible!

BUT, wait a minute... "bully" is a bit too obvious, isn't it? What if I told you that the answer is actually... (drumroll please)... the "pants pocket" (B)?

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

When something is "thrown up," it's typically referred to as something that's lifted or elevated. On the other hand, when something is "thrown down," it's typically referred to as something that's lowered or dropped.

Hmmm... What could be white when thrown up and white and yellow when thrown down?

I think I have it!

Is the answer an EGG?

When an egg is thrown up (or lifted), it's still white on the inside. And when it's thrown down (or cracked open), the yolk (yellow) is revealed!

A:
D D
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested!

1. "If you see me, I see you." - This implies that the answer is something that can be perceived or observed by sight.
2. "If you move, then I'll move too." - This suggests that the answer has a direct connection to movement or action.
3. "When you touch me, I touch you." - This implies a physical interaction or contact between the answer and the person.
4. "I do everything you do except for one thing." - This hints that the answer is closely tied to the person's actions, but with one significant exception.
5. "No matter how hard I try, I can never speak." - This final clue reveals the answer's inability to verbalize or communicate through language.

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that's a bit unconventional:

I think the correct answer is (D) your reflection!

Here's how it fits the clues:

* "If you see me, I see you": When you look at your reflection, you see yourself.
* "If you move, then I'll move too": When you move, your reflection moves as well, mimicking your actions.
* "When you touch me, I touch you": When you touch your reflection, it's as if you're touching yourself.
* "I do everything you do except for one thing": Your reflection does everything you do, but it can't speak or verbalize on its own.
* "No matter how hard I try, I can never speak": Your reflection can't communicate through language, as it's just a visual representation of yourself.

What do you think? Does this creative answer resonate with you?

A:
B B
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step...

"Ten Men's Strength" makes me think of something that requires collective effort to accomplish. Maybe something heavy?

"Ten Men's Length" suggests that the object is quite long, perhaps even bigger than a human.

"Ten Men can't break it" implies that the object is incredibly durable, resilient, or even indestructible!

And then, there's the twist: "Yet a young boy walks off with it". This makes me think that the object might be surprisingly lightweight or easy to carry, considering its size and strength.

Putting all these clues together, I'm going to take a bold leap...

I think the answer is (B) rope!

A rope can be quite long (Ten Men's Length), yet a young boy can easily carry it (walks off with it). It's also incredibly strong, requiring collective effort to break it (Ten Men can't break it). And, it's light enough for a child to handle.

A:
C E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's indeed think step by step. 

When you say "When I am filled I can point the way," I think of something that can be filled with a specific content, which would enable it to direct or indicate a path.

Hmm... Could it be related to direction or navigation?

Next, you mentioned "When I am empty, nothing moves me." This phrase makes me think of something that might not be capable of movement when it's empty or lacks the necessary substance.

Ah-ha! I wonder if the answer could be something that relies on its contents to function properly...

Moving on to the next clue: "I have two skins - One without and one within." This is an intriguing phrase! It implies that the object has an outer layer and an inner layer, which could be referring to its physical composition or perhaps its abstract characteristics.

Given these hints, I'm going to take a stab at the answer. I think it could be... (drumroll, please)... an INDEX FINGER!

Here's my reasoning:

* When the index finger is filled with knowledge or direction (e.g., pointing), it can guide or indicate a path.
* When it's empty (e.g., not knowing what to do), it won't move or act without that guidance.
* The "two skins" could refer to the outer layer of the finger (the skin) and the inner layer of the finger (the bone or muscle structure).

Let's break it down step by step, as you said.

* "Runs distances" implies that the answer is not stationary, it covers some ground.
* "Make many turns along the way" suggests that the path is not a straight line.
* "Yet it never moves one foot" is the key phrase here. It's a paradox! How can something cover distances and make turns without moving at all?

Hmmm... Could it be... (drumroll please)... 

I think the correct answer is (C) watch!

A watch "runs" in the sense that it ticks away, marking time. It can take many "turns" or laps around the clock face, but it itself doesn't physically move or change location. It's a clever play on words, isn't it?

Let's break it down:

* "I see what you see" - This phrase suggests that whatever I am, it's something that can perceive or observe something else.
* "I come in different colors" - This line implies that whatever I am, it can have different variations or attributes.
* "Without me, you'll be lost" - This part of the riddle suggests that whatever I am, it plays a crucial role in helping someone navigate or understand something.

Hmm... With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose that the answer might not be a literal "thing" at all!

What if the answer is actually a concept or an idea? In that case, I'd suggest that the correct answer is (A) Eye.

Here's my reasoning:

* "I see what you see" - An eye can perceive what you see, in a sense.
* "I come in different colors" - Eyes come in different colors, or rather, colors are perceived through the eyes!
* "Without me, you'll be lost" - Without eyes, we wouldn't be able to perceive the world around us, and we'd be lost in the dark, literally and figuratively!

Answer Choices: (A) comfort (B) red (C) giftwrap (D) root (E) snake
A:
E A
What a delightful riddle! Let's crack it open like an egg (pun intended).

Firstly, "I can sizzle like bacon" suggests something that can be cooked or heated, which is a great starting point.

Next, "I am made in an egg" is an intriguing clue. Eggs are often associated with new life, so perhaps the answer is something that's born or created from an egg?

The phrase "I have plenty of backbone, but lack of my legs" implies that the answer has a sturdy, strong foundation (backbone) but is missing some physical aspect (legs). This could be a metaphorical or literal absence.

The onion-like description "I peel layers like an onion, but still remain whole" suggests that the answer has multiple layers or aspects, but can be broken down or examined without losing its essence.

The contradictory statement "I can be long like a flag pole yet fit in a hole" indicates that the answer can be flexible or adaptable, possibly changing shape or size depending on the context.

Finally, "I come at you in all sorts of colors, and sometimes I like being around water" hints that the answer has a range of appearances (colors) and can thrive in aquatic environments.

Considering all these clues, my creative mind is sparking some possibilities...

What a delightfully cryptic riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Hundreds of legs": This is likely a metaphor, not meant to be taken literally. Perhaps it's referring to something that has many extensions, branches, or parts that resemble legs.
* "But I can only lean": This suggests that whatever it is, it's unable to move or stand upright in the classical sense. It might be limited in its mobility or stability.
* "You make me feel dirty so you can feel clean": This is a clever play on words! The phrase "make me feel dirty" implies that the subject is somehow connected to dirt or grime, while "so you can feel clean" suggests that the subject is somehow related to cleaning or purification.

Taking these clues into account, I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark...

Could the answer be (A) broom? A broom has many "legs" (bristles) but is typically used to sweep and clean surfaces, making it feel "dirty" in the process, allowing the user to feel clean afterward?

Q: These delicious pork meat strips is enjoyed at breakfast time along side sausage, eggs and toast Answer Choices: (A) freezer (B) pig (C) beef stew (D) bacon (E) hog
A:

A delicious breakfast question!

Let's start by breaking down the sentence: "These delicious pork meat strips is enjoyed at breakfast time along side sausage, eggs and toast"

We know that pork meat strips are being enjoyed at breakfast, and they're accompanied by sausage, eggs, and toast. That sounds like a tasty breakfast combo!

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

(A) freezer - Hmm, unlikely. Meat strips aren't typically stored in freezers, but rather cooked and served.

(B) pig - Now we're getting somewhere! Pigs are the source of pork, so this could be the correct answer. But...

(C) beef stew - Wait, what? This doesn't make sense. Beef stew isn't typically enjoyed at breakfast, and it's not related to the description of pork meat strips.

(D) bacon - Ah, bacon is a type of pork, and it's often enjoyed at breakfast! But...

(E) hog - A hog is a type of pig, so this could be the correct answer too!

After careful consideration, I think the correct answer is... both (B) pig and (E) hog! The question asks about the source of the pork meat strips, and both "pig" and "hog" refer to the same animal.

So, there you have it! The answer is not just one, but two!

A:
D A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step to unravel its mystery.

First, the riddle states that the answer "formed long ago, yet made today." This suggests that the answer is something that has an ancient origin, but is still created or manufactured in the present day.

Next, the riddle mentions that the answer is "Employed while others sleep." This implies that the answer is related to work or a job, and that it's something that people do during their free time, perhaps at night or early in the morning when others are asleep.

The third line of the riddle states that the answer is "What none would freely give away. Nor any wish to keep." This is an intriguing clue! It suggests that the answer is something that people wouldn't willingly part with, but also wouldn't want to keep or retain.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

(A) Fall asleep: This doesn't quite fit the bill, as sleep is a natural process and not something that's formed or made.

(B) Store: This is an interesting option, but it doesn't quite capture the essence of the riddle. Stores are places where people store goods, not something that's made or formed.

(C) Office: Offices are workplaces, but the riddle doesn't quite fit this option either. Offices are not typically something that's formed or made.

(D) Bed: Ah, now this is an intriguing option! Beds are indeed something that people sleep on, and they're typically formed or manufactured. However, the riddle's final line about no one wanting to keep or give away a bed doesn't quite ring true.

(E) Factory: Ah, but what if the answer is a factory itself? Factories are indeed formed or created, and they're often employed at night or during off-hours when others are asleep. Moreover, factories are places where goods are manufactured, which fits the "made today" part of the riddle. And, if we think about it, factories are not something that people would

A:

What a classic riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

"Rock and roll" is a phrase that evokes a sense of music, energy, and movement. So, we're looking for something that's associated with "rock" but doesn't actually "roll".

(A) Insects don't quite fit the bill, as they don't typically have anything to do with rock music.

(B) Cinnamon is a tasty spice, but it's not exactly related to rock and roll either.

(C) Ah, but a rocking chair is a great candidate! It's something that's designed to "rock" back and forth, but it doesn't actually roll like a vehicle might.

(D) A vehicle is a good guess, but even a rock-solid car or truck doesn't quite fit the description, since it does roll on wheels.

(E) Heavy is a bit of a stretch, as it's more of a descriptive term than an object that "rocks" in the classical sense.

So, I'm going to take a bold step and choose... (C) Rocking chair! What do you think? Am I rocking my answer correctly?

I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is (D) carpet!

Here's my reasoning: You go up and down the stairs, which implies you're moving vertically, but you're not physically moving yourself. You're staying in the same place, but the stairs are changing beneath your feet. That's where the carpet comes in - it's what you're stepping on, going up and down, without actually moving yourself!

Q: What owns a bank, but never uses money?

Hmm... Who owns a bank? Could it be the... BANK itself? A bank is an institution that provides financial services, but it doesn't use money for personal gain. It's more like a custodian of funds, rather than a user of them.

So, I'm going to take a chance and choose (A) casino. A casino owns a bank (as in, it has a bank within its premises) but doesn't use money for personal gain.

Now, let's move on to the second part of the question:

Q: What runs but never walks?

Hmm... What runs, but doesn't walk? Could it be a RIVER? A river flows (or runs) continuously, but it doesn't walk!

"Open me, and you can't see me without a mirror."

Hmm... This suggests that when something is "open", it's not directly visible, but a mirror is needed to reflect it, making it visible.

"Close me and you can't see me at all."

This part implies that when something is "closed", it's completely invisible, not just reflected or indirectly visible.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer that might just fit the bill...

* "Shoots" you: Hmm, that could be a verb, like "exposes" you to something. But it could also be a physical object that "shoots" or propels something.

* "Allows you to move all at the same time": Okay, this is where things get really interesting! If we're thinking about movement, we could be talking about something that enables or facilitates movement.

Putting it all together, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is... (E) camera!

Flying forever, rest never, huh? That's quite an intriguing riddle!

My first thought is: "What's always moving, yet never takes a break?" And that's when I land (pun intended!) on the idea that the answer might be something that's constantly in motion, but never experiences rest.

Now, let's examine each option:

(A) Net: While a net does have openings, it's not always "flying" or moving forever. It's a bit static, if you will.

(B) Change: Ah, but change is indeed a constant process! We're always changing, adapting, evolving... And it's hard to imagine change ever resting.

(C) Wind: Now we're getting somewhere! The wind is indeed always moving, blowing, and never resting. It's a constant force of nature!

(D) Opening: An opening is more like a gap or a hole, rather than a continuous movement. It's not always "flying" or moving forever.

(E) Open Ocean: The open ocean is vast and dynamic, with currents and waves always in motion. It's a great fit for our description!

So, after some creative contemplation, I'm going to take a deep breath and declare that the correct answer is... (drumroll please)... C) Wind!

Let's take a step back and consider the nature of vampires. They're creatures of the night, often shrouded in mystery and secrecy. They're not exactly known for their love of sunlight or their affinity for traditional banking systems.

Hmmm... If vampires did use money, it would likely be something that reflects their dark, mystical, and ancient nature. Something that whispers eerie tales of the undead and the afterlife.

Imagine it: a currency that flows like the life force of the living, yet is as cold and dark as the grave. Vampires could exchange blood tokens, each one imbued with the essence of a willing donor. The value of these tokens would be measured in the depth of the donor's despair, the fear of their demise, or the desperation of their survival.

In this world, a vampire could trade a vial of Type O negative for a rare book on alchemy or a vial of Type AB positive for a whispered secret about the mortal realm. The concept of interest would be replaced by the thrill of the hunt, as vampires would seek to collect the most valuable and coveted blood tokens to fuel their immortal lives.

Hmm... what could this mysterious jar hold?

2. The phrase "bottomless jar" makes me think of something that's endless, or has no limits.
3. "Flesh and blood" is a phrase that usually refers to human beings, or at least living creatures.
4. King Henry the Eighth was known for his many marriages and his... let's say, "fascination" with women.

Now, let's combine these clues!

I think I've got it! King Henry the Eighth gave his wife... a "bag" of children! Get it? A "bottomless jar" that can hold "flesh and blood" (children) is a clever play on words!

So, I'm going to choose answer choice (B) bag!

A:

What a delightfully mind-bending question!

Let's break it down:

* "Yesterday had been Wednesday's tomorrow" means that yesterday was actually tomorrow (in a parallel universe where Wednesdays are tomorrow). So, yesterday is actually Thursday (because Wednesdays would be tomorrow).
* "Tomorrow is Sunday's yesterday" means that tomorrow is actually yesterday (in a parallel universe where Sundays are yesterday). So, tomorrow is actually Saturday (because Sundays would be yesterday).

Now, let's think about today...

If yesterday was Thursday and tomorrow is Saturday, that means today is... (drumroll please)... FRIDAY!

So, the correct answer is (D) Friday!

Q: Thirty-two white horses on a red hill.  When you talk, they move.  When you're silent, they stand still.  They can be lost, but replaced only once.  Answer Choices: (A) mind (B) country (C) teeth (D) talk (E) motion
A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's embark on this creative journey together!

Firstly, let's consider the horses. Thirty-two white horses on a red hill is quite an intriguing combination. Red and white are opposing colors, and the contrast between the two might be significant. The fact that they move when you talk and stand still when you're silent suggests a connection to sound and silence.

Now, let's ponder the idea of them being lost and replaceable only once. This implies that the connection between the horses and the concept of "loss" is crucial. Perhaps the horses are not just physical entities but also represent an abstract idea or a metaphor.

Considering the answer choices, (D) talk seems like a promising candidate. When you talk, the horses move, and when you're silent, they stand still. This could be interpreted as the horses being tied to the concept of speech and communication.

However, there's still the aspect of "loss" and "replacement" to consider. Could the answer be related to the idea of "words" rather than just "talk"? Perhaps the horses represent the words you say, and when they're "lost," it means you've forgotten or misremembered them. When they're replaced, it means you've recovered or learned new words to compensate for the lost ones.

Taking this idea further, I propose that the correct answer is (A) mind. The mind is where our thoughts, words, and memories reside. The horses, in this context, could represent the words and ideas stored in our minds. When we talk, the horses move, symbolizing the flow of thoughts and ideas. When we're silent, they stand still, indicating that our minds are at rest. The idea of "loss" and "replacement" could be related to the concept of forgetting and recalling memories or learning new information to replace forgotten knowledge.

What do you think? Am I galloping in the right direction or getting lost in the red hill?

Answer Choices: (A) fearless (B) vain (C) egg (D) rooster (E) challenge
A:
D A
What a fascinating poem!

Let's break it down and see if we can crack the code.

The poem describes someone who is:

* Vigilant and courageous, with few equals
* Prized by industrious people, but despised by indolent ones
* Bold and alert in battle, without showing off
* Willing to take on a foe, but if they're too strong, they'll retreat with one loss

Hmm... The language is quite vivid and evocative. I'm getting a sense of someone who is strong, yet humble; brave, yet strategic.

Now, let's look at the answer choices.

(A) Fearless doesn't quite fit, as the poem mentions "without valour show," implying that the person's bravery is not showy or boastful.

(B) Vain is also a poor fit, as the poem describes someone who is respected by hardworking people, not someone who is self-absorbed.

(C) Egg... Hmm, I'm not seeing an egg anywhere in the poem.

(D) Rooster... Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Roosters are known for their bravery and vigilance, especially when it comes to defending their territory.

(E) Challenge... This answer choice seems a bit too vague to fit the poem's specific language and themes.

Based on our analysis, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is... (D) Rooster!

Am I correct, or am I just winging it?

As a velophile, I love... (drumroll please)... the VELOCITY OF LIFE!

Think about it: as a velophile, I'm drawn to the thrill of the ride, the rush of adrenaline as I pedal, the wind in my hair, the world whizzing by in a blur. It's not just about the bicycle (although, let's be real, it's a fantastic part of the equation); it's about the sense of freedom, the feeling of being alive, and the joy of moving at a pace that's just out of the ordinary.

So, while the correct answer might seem to be (E) bicycle, I'd argue that my true love is the velocity, the dynamism, and the excitement that comes with embracing the ride!

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle! Let's dive into it and see where it takes us.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "At day i play": This suggests that whatever "I" am, I'm active during the day.
2. "At night i hide": This implies that I'm not as visible or active at night, perhaps I'm hiding or taking a break.
3. "I'm always right behind you": This is a intriguing clue! It suggests that I'm always present, but not always visible.
4. "You can never always know when you can see me": This is a clever phrase! It implies that I'm unpredictable, and my visibility is hard to predict.
5. "I'm very secretive": This final clue reinforces the idea that I'm not easy to find or understand.

Now, let's think about each answer choice:

(A) Frogs: They're active during the day, but they're not always visible, and they might hide in water or under leaves. However, frogs aren't necessarily secretive, and they're not always behind us.

(B) Invisible: This is an interesting option, but it's not a specific entity, and it doesn't quite fit the other clues.

(C) Daytime: This option doesn't quite work, as daytime is a time of day, not an entity that plays, hides, or is secretive.

(D) Plough: A plough is a farming tool, and it's not clear how it fits the clues.

(E) Shadow: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Shadows are present during the day, but they're more prominent at night when the light source is behind us. Shadows can be unpredictable and fleeting, making it hard to predict when you'll see them. And shadows are often secretive, hiding in the crevices of objects or blending with the surrounding darkness.

Given the clues, I think the correct answer is (E) Shadow! What do you think?

Q: What is born in the winter, dies in the summer and hangs from itâ€™s roots? Answer Choices: (A) fruit (B) icicle (C) cold weather (D) brook (E) tap
A:

A classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's break it down:

* "Born in the winter": This suggests something that starts to exist or grows during the winter season. What comes to mind?
* "Dies in the summer": This implies that whatever it is, it has a limited lifespan and eventually perishes during the summer. Hmm...
* "Hangs from its roots": This is the most intriguing part! What kind of object or living thing could hang from its own roots?

Ah-ha! Let's combine these clues and think outside the box...

I propose that the answer is (D) brook! 

Here's my reasoning:

* "Born in the winter": Brook is a term that refers to a small, narrow stream or creek, which could be born or start flowing during the winter season, perhaps due to snowmelt or rainfall.
* "Dies in the summer": Brook's flow could slow down or even dry up during the summer months due to increased evaporation, heat, or reduced precipitation.
* "Hangs from its roots": Ah, but here's the creative twist! Brook refers to the source of the stream or creek, which is often found at the roots of a hill, mountain, or valley. So, in a sense, the brook "hangs" from its own roots!

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "Plates use it." - Ah-ha! Plates use... (drumroll please)... A TONGUE! Plates need a tongue to hold onto something, like a tongue depressor or a spatula.

2. "Trees loose it." - Ah, the word "loose" is a clever play on words! Trees shed... LEAVES!

3. "Dad persuses it." - Ah, a clever pun! Dad pursues... A PURSUIT! Perhaps Dad is an avid hunter or angler, and he pursues his prey.

4. "Fire chews it." - Whoa, this one's a doozy! Fire consumes... FUEL! Fire chews through fuel to keep burning.

Putting it all together, I'd say the answer is... (drumroll please)... TONGUE!

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "You enter one hole and leave three": This could be referring to a physical object that has a hole in it, and when you put something into that hole, three things come out. Hmm...
* "Once you succeed, I'm on thee": This suggests that the object is somehow connected to or attached to the person who "succeeds" in using it.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark (pun intended) and say that the answer is... (D) mine field!

Here's my reasoning:

* When you enter a mine field, you're entering a field with many holes (mines). If you successfully navigate through it without triggering any mines, you can "leave" the field without being harmed.
* And when you succeed in not setting off any mines, the mine field is "on thee" - i.e., it's attached to you, as you've successfully avoided its dangers!

A:
E E
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "What goes with a train": This suggests something that is typically associated with trains, like a companion or a partner.
* "Stops with a train": This implies that whatever we're thinking of stops moving when the train stops.
* "Has no use for the train": This is an interesting clue, as it suggests that the thing in question doesn't need the train for its existence or function.
* "but a train can't go two feet without it": Ah, this is the clincher! It implies that the thing in question is essential for the train to move, even if it's just for a short distance.

With these clues in mind, let's take a closer look at the answer choices:

* (A) cost money: While trains do require money to operate, this doesn't quite fit the bill. Trains don't stop because they're worried about the cost of operation!
* (B) change: Trains do change tracks, but that's not the connection we're looking for here.
* (C) ball: While trains do have ballast to stabilize the tracks, this doesn't quite fit the description.
* (D) taste: Trains don't really have a taste, nor do they need something to taste to operate!
* (E) noise: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Noise is something that's often associated with trains, and...

Wait a minute!

I think I've got it!

The answer is (E) noise!

Here's why:

* "What goes with a train": Noise is often associated with trains, as they make a lot of noise when they're moving.
* "Stops with a train": When a train stops, the noise stops too.
* "Has no use for the train": Noise doesn't need the train to exist or function.
* "but a train can't go two feet without it": A train can't move without making noise, even if it's just a short distance!

Q: What thing eats everything in sight, But cannot stand liquid? Answer Choices: (A) sweat (B) ice (C) liquid nitrogen (D) fire (E) stomach
A:

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "What thing eats everything in sight": This suggests that the thing in question is an entity that consumes or devours things, possibly by "eating" or "digesting" them.
2. "But cannot stand liquid": This implies that the thing has some sort of limitation or aversion to liquids.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Sweat: Sweat is a liquid, so it can't be the correct answer.

B. Ice: Ice is a solid, not a liquid, so it's not a good fit either.

C. Liquid nitrogen: Liquid nitrogen is a liquid, so it doesn't match the description.

D. Fire: Fire is often thought of as consuming or "eating" things, like wood or fuel. And, as a matter of fact, fire doesn't like being quenched with liquid (water, for instance) - it can't stand it!

E. Stomach: Ah-ha! A stomach is an entity that "eats" or digests food, and it can't stand liquids like water or other beverages. The stomach lining is actually designed to digest solid foods, not liquids.

So, the correct answer is E) Stomach!

What a delightful riddle! Let's indeed think step by step, and I'll guide us through a creative and imaginative journey!

Step 1: Let's focus on the first two lines: "Though it be cold, i wear no clothes, the frost and snow i never fear..." Ah, the speaker is describing someone who is immune to the cold, which is quite remarkable! This already gives us a hint about the answer.

Step 2: The next line is: "i value neither shoes nor hose, and yet i wander far and near..." This tells us that the speaker doesn't need shoes or clothes, which reinforces our initial impression. It also implies that they're quite agile and can move around freely.

Step 3: The following lines describe the speaker's diet: "my diet is forever good, i drink no cider, port, nor sack..." This suggests that the speaker doesn't consume any traditional human foods or drinks. Instead, they might be relying on something else for sustenance.

Step 4: The final lines reveal that the speaker doesn't buy, sell, or lack food: "what providence doth send for food, i neither buy, nor sell, nor lack..." This implies that the speaker is receiving food from an unknown source, which might be connected to their ability to survive in the cold.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

(A) Prepare: Hmm, this doesn't quite fit, as the speaker is the one who's doing the eating, not preparing food.

(B) Deep: This is an interesting choice, but I think we can do better. What about something more concrete?

(C) Recipe: Nope, not quite. Recipes are human creations, and the speaker seems to be receiving their food from a different source.

Let's break it down:

1. "It captures you": This suggests that whatever it is, it has a strong hold or grasp on the person.
2. "It moves you": This could imply that it evokes emotions, motivates action, or perhaps even physically moves the person.
3. "And then it's gone": This implies that whatever it is, it's fleeting and ephemeral, disappearing quickly.
4. "It tingles in the back of your head, tempting you to chase it": This suggests that whatever it is, it leaves a lingering sensation or craving, encouraging the person to pursue it.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and propose an answer:

(E) Imagination

Here's my reasoning:

* "It captures you": Imagination has the power to capture our attention and imagination, drawing us in.
* "It moves you": Imagination can inspire creativity, drive emotions, and motivate action.
* "And then it's gone": Ideas, stories, or creative sparks can come and go quickly, leaving us with a lingering sense of wonder or longing.
* "It tingles in the back of your head, tempting you to chase it": The creative spark or idea can leave us with a lasting impression, encouraging us to pursue it further.

We're looking for something that "talks" but can't "walk". The word "talks" implies that it's making sounds or speaking in some way. The word "walk" implies movement or locomotion.

Let's break it down:

* "Thing bounces" - This suggests that the object has some elasticity or springiness to it.
* "Very curly" - This gives us a visual clue about the shape of the object. It's likely to be a curly, springy shape rather than a straight or flat one.
* "Meant to use for pressing pens" - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! This suggests that the object is used in conjunction with writing instruments, and "pressing" pens implies some kind of application of pressure or force.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose an answer...

I think the correct answer is (B) caps! Specifically, eraser caps or clip caps that fit onto the end of a pen or pencil. These caps are designed to absorb pressure and "bounce back" into shape when pressed, and they often have a curly, springy shape to them. Am I correct?

Q: In the middle of night, i surround the gong in the middle of sight, i end the song Answer Choices: (A) g (B) music store (C) church (D) symphony (E) music
A:

What an intriguing question!

Let's dissect it together:

* "In the middle of night" - This suggests that the scenario is taking place at a unusual time, perhaps when the world is quiet.
* "I surround the gong" - A gong is a type of musical instrument, often used in traditional Asian music. Surrounding it implies that you're physically present near it.
* "In the middle of sight" - This phrase is a bit ambiguous, but "sight" could refer to a physical location or a visual experience. "In the middle of" implies that you're in the center of something.
* "I end the song" - This implies that there was a song or music playing, and you're the one responsible for stopping it.

Putting all these pieces together, I'd take a stab at the answer being (C) church. Here's my reasoning:

In many churches, especially those with traditional or Eastern influences, a gong is often used as a musical instrument during services or ceremonies. "In the middle of sight" could refer to the church's altar or a central location within the church. And "I end the song" suggests that you might be a member of the choir, a musician, or even the worship leader, responsible for bringing the musical portion of the service to a close.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation. I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if I'm on the right track!

Q: You can break it or drink water from it Answer Choices: (A) glass (B) drop (C) bottle (D) teapot (E) hose
A:
A A
What a clever question!

Let's break it down (pun intended!)

1. "Break it": This implies that the object can be physically broken or damaged in some way. With that in mind...
2. "Drink water from it": This suggests that the object is somehow related to water, and we can consume it.

Now, let's analyze each answer choice:

(A) Glass: We can break a glass, and it's often used to drink water from. Bingo!

So, the correct answer is (A) glass!

A:

What a delightful challenge!

Let's break it down:

* "As light as a feather" suggests something very airy, weightless, and easy to lift.
* "But you can't hold it for ten minutes" implies that whatever it is, it's either intangible or ephemeral, making it difficult to grasp or maintain.

Hmmm... Which one of the options fits this description?

I think I've got it!

The correct answer is: (E) your breath!

You can hold your breath for a few seconds, maybe even a minute or two, but it's extremely challenging to hold your breath for ten minutes. And, of course, your breath is as light as a feather!

What do you think? Am I correct?

Q: In a tunnel of darkness lies a beast of iron.  It can only attack when pulled back.  What is it? Answer Choices: (A) hit (B) proof (C) bullet (D) treasure chest (E) hurt
A:
C A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's indeed think step by step.

Firstly, the phrase "a tunnel of darkness" suggests that the beast is hidden from view, perhaps waiting to be triggered or activated. The fact that it can only attack when "pulled back" implies some sort of mechanical or mechanical-like action.

Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:

(A) Hit doesn't quite fit, as the beast is not attacking when it's "pulled back".

(B) Proof doesn't make sense in this context, as it's not a type of attack.

(C) Bullet is an intriguing option, but the phrase "pulled back" implies a more deliberate action than simply firing a bullet.

(D) Treasure chest is an interesting choice, but it doesn't quite fit the description of a beast that attacks when pulled back.

(E) Hurt is a possible answer, but it's quite vague and doesn't quite capture the mechanical aspect of the beast's attack.

Now, let's think outside the box! What if the beast is not a living creature, but rather a mechanism? What if it's a...

A spring-loaded trap! When pulled back, the spring is coiled, ready to release its stored energy and attack!

So, my answer is (E) hurt, but with a twist! The beast is not a creature that hurts, but rather a mechanical device that springs into action when pulled back, causing harm to those who trigger it!

What do you think? Am I correct?

Q: My thunder rolls beneath me, my lightning flares above.  I dust the crust, and when I bust, all I touch will I shove.    What am I? Answer Choices: (A) shell (B) bottom of sea (C) lightning rod (D) hill (E) volcano
A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's unleash our creative minds and dive into the depths of possibility!

First, let's break down the clues:

* "My thunder rolls beneath me": This suggests something that makes a loud, rumbling sound, which is often associated with powerful forces.
* "My lightning flares above": This implies a connection to the sky, with a bright, flashing light.
* "I dust the crust": This phrase could refer to something that removes or erases the surface layer of something.
* "And when I bust, all I touch will I shove": This final part implies a sudden release of energy, with the object being pushed or moved in some way.

With these clues in mind, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Shell: While shells can make a thunder-like sound when they break, it doesn't quite fit the rest of the description. Shells aren't typically associated with lightning or dusting crusts.

B. Bottom of sea: This option is intriguing, but the phrase "dust the crust" implies a more terrestrial context. The bottom of the sea doesn't typically "dust" anything, and it's unclear how it would "bust" and shove things around.

C. Lightning rod: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Lightning rods do attract lightning, which fits the "lightning flares above" clue. However, they don't typically "dust the crust" or cause a sudden, forceful movement.

D. Hill: This option is interesting, but the description seems to be more focused on intense, energetic events rather than a gradual slope.

E. Volcano: Ah-ha! This is where the puzzle starts to come together! Volcanoes are known for their thunderous rumblings ( earthquakes and eruptions), lightning flashes (during ash clouds and storms), and dusty eruptions that can cover the surrounding area. When a volcano "busts," it releases a massive amount of energy, potentially causing widespread destruction and reshaping the surrounding landscape

A:
A C
What a refreshing question!

Let's dive into the mystery, shall we?

1. "If you cut my head, I'm at your door" - This could mean that if you cut off the "head" of the answer, you'd be left with something that's at the entrance of a building, like a doorstep.
2. "If you cut my tail, I'm fruit" - Hmm, cutting off the "tail" of the answer might result in something that's edible and grows on trees... like a fruit!
3. "If you cut both, I'm with you" - This one's a bit tricky! Cutting off both the head and tail might leave you with something that's closely associated with humans, something that's often with us...

Now, let's put the puzzle pieces together!

Considering the possibilities, I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... an "OCEAN!"

Here's how it fits:

* Cutting off the "head" of the ocean (its surface) would leave you at the doorstep of a building, like a beachside entrance.
* Cutting off the "tail" of the ocean (its deep, dark parts) would leave you with water, which can be thought of as a fruit (e.g., a coconut or a melon).
* Cutting off both the head and tail of the ocean would leave you with the water itself, which is often with us humans!

Am I correct, or did I just get swept away by the tide of possibilities?

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "im white im round, but im not always around" - This could refer to something that's typically white and round, but not always present or visible.
* "im light, im dark, sometimes im both" - This suggests that whatever it is, it can have contrasting properties, like light and dark.
* "everybody wants to walk on me, but only few happy feet ever have" - This implies that many people might want to experience or interact with this thing, but only a select few actually do.

Hmm... With these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap!

I think the answer might be... (drumroll please)... a SNOWFLAKE!

Here's how it fits:

* "im white im round, but im not always around" - Snowflakes are typically white and round, but they're fleeting and ephemeral, disappearing soon after they fall.
* "im light, im dark, sometimes im both" - Snowflakes can reflect light and appear bright, but they can also absorb light and appear dark. And sometimes, they can have both white and dark areas, like the delicate patterns on their surface.
* "everybody wants to walk on me, but only few happy feet ever have" - Many people might want to experience the joy of walking on snow, but not everyone gets to do it, especially in the winter. Those who do get to walk on snow might feel "happy feet"!

A:

What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, as you suggested:

1. "What comes first and follows after": This phrase makes me think of a cycle or a loop. Something that begins and then repeats. Hmm...

2. "ends life": Ah-ha! This gives me a hint that the answer is related to mortality or the end of something. 

3. "kills laughter": This part makes me think of something that extinguishes joy or happiness.

Now, let's put these clues together...

I think the answer is "darkness"!

Here's my reasoning:

* "What comes first and follows after" could refer to the cycle of day and night, where darkness comes first in the morning and follows after the sun sets.
* "ends life" is a common association with darkness, as it can represent the unknown or the end of light.
* "kills laughter" is also a fitting connection, as darkness can extinguish the joy and happiness associated with laughter.

So, my answer is (A) darkness! What do you think?

A:

What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down:

* "Every day you walk on us": This suggests that the answer is something that is walked upon or stepped on daily.
* "We can't work without each other": This implies a sense of dependence or interconnectedness between the two entities.
* "And never can I help you": This adds a layer of complexity, suggesting that the relationship is not one of mutual aid or assistance.

Hmmm... Putting these clues together, I'm going to take a bold step (pun intended) and propose that the answer is:

(B) Shadow!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Every day you walk on us" refers to the fact that we walk on the ground, which is often accompanied by our shadows.
* "We can't work without each other" suggests that our presence and movement create the shadow, which is an integral part of our daily lives.
* "And never can I help you" implies that the shadow doesn't offer assistance or aid, but rather accompanies us passively.

Q: what has eyes but cant see Answer Choices: (A) faces (B) machine (C) lizard (D) lacrimal apparatus (E) potato
A:
E A
What a delightful question!

Let's break it down:

1. "What has eyes..." - Ah, that's a good start! Eyes are a pretty distinctive feature, so we're likely looking for something with a pair of peepers.
2. "...but can't see..." - Hmm, this is where things get interesting. If it has eyes but can't see, that means it's probably not a living thing that needs to see to survive. Maybe it's an inanimate object or a concept?

Now, let's review the answer choices:

(A) faces - That's a great option! Faces often have eyes, but they don't exactly "see" in the classical sense. They're more like... decorative features?

(B) machine - This could be a contender! Machines can have cameras or sensors that mimic eyes, but they don't exactly "see" like living beings do.

(C) lizard - This one's a bit of a stretch, as lizards are living creatures that can see just fine.

(D) lacrimal apparatus - This is a fancy way of saying "tear ducts." While it's true that eyes have tear ducts, I'm not sure that's what the question is getting at.

(E) potato - Now this is an interesting choice! Potatoes don't have eyes in the classical sense, but they do have "eyes" in the sense that they're the little buds on the potato that sprout into new plants. And, of course, potatoes are often grown underground, where they can't "see" in the classical sense.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the correct answer is... (A) faces!

A:
C C
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I have four of these" - This suggests that the answer is a plural noun, and the "these" could be a specific part of the body.
* "With matching extremities" - This implies that the extremities are similar or identical to each other, which is an interesting clue.
* "They can do many things" - This tells us that the answer is capable of performing various actions.
* "And hardly ever bring me pain" - This suggests that the answer is not typically associated with pain or discomfort.
* "Unless I stick them with a pin" - Ah, a dramatic turn! This implies that the answer can cause pain if treated roughly.
* "Or burn them sometimes when.... " - This adds to the idea that the answer can be susceptible to harm if not handled carefully.
* "What is it that I can wiggle at will?" - This is a crucial clue! It suggests that the answer is something that can be moved or manipulated voluntarily.
* "And use in other means still?" - This implies that the answer has multiple purposes or uses.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at the answer...

I think the correct answer is (C) fingers!

Here's my reasoning:

* "Four of these" refers to the four fingers on each hand.
* "Matching extremities" describes the similarity between fingers.
* "They can do many things" is true, as fingers are incredibly versatile and can be used for various tasks, from typing to playing instruments.
* "Hardly ever bring me pain" is also true, as fingers are not typically a source of chronic pain (unless, of course, you're dealing with an injury or condition).
* "Unless I stick them with a pin" - Ouch! Fingers can

Let's break it down:

* "IT DROOLS IN AUTO ZONE" - Hmm, interesting! Auto Zone is a car parts store, so it's unlikely an animal would be drooling in there. Unless... unless it's something that's often associated with cars, like a mascot or a character.
* "CLAIMS SPORTS ARE EDUCATIONAL" - This suggests that "it" has an opinion or a perspective on the importance of sports. Perhaps "it" is someone who is passionate about sports or has a job related to sports.
* "AND IT IS MESSIER THAN THE DOG" - Ahaha, this is a great clue! It implies that "it" is capable of making a mess, but even a dog would be embarrassed by the level of messiness "it" is capable of. This could be a playful jab at "it" being a bit of a klutz.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think "it" is a SPORTS COMMENTATOR! They're often passionate about sports, claim that sports are educational, and might be a bit of a goofball, making them messier than a dog. Am I right?

I'm also not considering bird nests, as they're not trees at all!

Sunshine is not a tree either... although it's lovely to bask in its warmth!

A:

What an intriguing set of statements!

Let's break it down:

1. "I have a mouse that doesn't eat cheese": This suggests that the mouse has a unique dietary preference or restriction. Perhaps it's a mouse that's lactose intolerant or has a different nutritional requirement?
2. "I can surf without a wave": Ah, now this is where things get interesting! It implies that you're talking about a non-physical, virtual, or abstract surfing experience. Maybe you're referring to surfing the internet, navigating social media, or even browsing through a vast digital library?
3. "I have a web that doesn't have a spider": This raises questions about the nature of the web. Is it a digital web, like a social media platform or a online community? Or could it be a physical web, like a fabric or a network of connections, but without the typical eight-legged spider at its center?

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) Grind: This doesn't quite fit, as the statements seem to be pointing towards more abstract or virtual concepts rather than physical actions.

(B) Computer: Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A computer is a hub for digital connections, a platform for surfing the internet, and a device that can access a vast web of information. It's a perfect match for the statements!

(C) Lift: This option doesn't seem to fit as well, as the statements don't explicitly mention lifting or physical actions.

(D) A chair: While a chair could potentially be used to lift or grind, it's not a direct match for the abstract concepts presented.

(E) Cereal box: This option seems unrelated to the statements, which describe digital or virtual experiences.

A:
E A
The classic "what goes up but never comes back down" riddle! I love a good challenge.

Let's break it down, as you suggested. I'll consider each answer choice and see if it fits the bill.

(A) Turn: A turn can indeed go up, like a turn in a staircase or a turn in a road. However, a turn can also come back down, like a U-turn. So, this option is out.

(B) Experience: Ah, but experience can indeed come back down to us! We can reflect on past experiences, learn from them, and even relive them through memory. So, experience doesn't quite fit the bill.

(C) Adventure: This option has some potential! An adventure can certainly go up, like a thrilling climb to new heights. But, what about when the adventure is over? We can always look back on it fondly, relive it through photos or stories, or even plan another adventure. So, adventure doesn't quite "never come back down" either.

(D) Tension: Now we're getting somewhere! Tension can indeed go up, like the feeling of anticipation before a big event. But, when the event is over, the tension often dissipates or is released. So, while tension can go up, it's not always a one-way journey.

(E) Your age: Ah, now we're talking! Our age is a unique case. We can certainly go up in age, but our age never comes back down. Once we've reached a certain age, we can't un-age ourselves. We can't turn back the clock and become younger. So, the correct answer is...

(E) Your age!

Q: i weigh nothing. i see nothing. you live without me , but i don't touch you Answer Choices: (A) space shuttle (B) rub (C) world (D) farm (E) outer space
A:
E A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's embark on this creative journey together!

Since you weigh nothing, that suggests a lack of physical presence or mass. This is a great clue!

The phrase "I see nothing" implies a lack of visual perception or awareness.

Now, the statement "you live without me" could be interpreted in a few ways, but it might imply that the entity is not essential for the existence or functioning of something else.

The final clue "but I don't touch you" adds an interesting layer, as it suggests a lack of physical interaction or contact.

With these hints in mind, let's explore each option:

(A) Space shuttle: While space shuttles are impressive, they do have physical presence and mass, so this doesn't quite fit.

(B) Rub: A rub implies physical contact or friction, which contradicts the "I don't touch you" part.

(C) World: Ah, now this is an interesting choice! The world is vast and encompasses everything, but it's not a single entity that "lives" or exists without something else. It's more like the world is the context in which things exist.

(D) Farm: Farms are physical places with tangible objects and living beings, so this option doesn't fit the "I weigh nothing" and "I see nothing" criteria.

(E) Outer space: This is an intriguing choice! Outer space is essentially the vacuum of space, which has no physical presence or mass (in the sense that it's not a solid object). Additionally, outer space is often described as being devoid of light or visual perception, which aligns with "I see nothing." Finally, the lack of physical interaction or contact between objects in outer space fits the "I don't touch you" part.

Given these creative leaps and connections, I'm going to take a chance and say that the correct answer is (E) Outer space!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested.

1. "What is disgusting, but not seen": Hmm, something that's gross, but you can't see it directly...
2. "Deadly": Ooh, something that can be hazardous or even lethal!
3. "Makes your face green": Ah, a classic symptom of... nausea!
4. "Is shoved up in your face": Whoa, something that's suddenly and forcefully imposed on you!
5. "Let's you know when you need space": Ah, an interesting one! Something that says, "Hey, back off a bit!"
6. "Is terrible to smell": Yuck, something that reeks!
7. "Really makes you want to yell": Okay, I get it! Something that's so obnoxious, you just want to scream!

Q: i shine in the sky rise in the morn i fade way at night and leave beautiful colors behind.   what shines in the morn and what takes my place at night? Answer Choices: (A) places (B) hiding place (C) sun and moon (D) constellation (E) handle
A:
C B
What a intriguing riddle! Let's take it one step at a time, shall we?

Firstly, you "shine in the sky" which implies that you are something that radiates light or has a bright appearance. This could be an object, a phenomenon, or even a celestial body!

Next, you "rise in the morning" which suggests that you appear or become visible at the start of the day.

Then, you "fade away at night" which implies that you cease to be visible or your brightness diminishes as the day ends.

Finally, you "leave beautiful colors behind" which hints at the stunning visual display that remains after you've disappeared from view.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) places - This doesn't quite fit, as places don't typically shine, rise, or fade away.

(B) hiding place - This is an interesting option, but hiding places aren't typically associated with shining, rising, or leaving beautiful colors behind.

(C) sun and moon - Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere! The sun rises in the morning, shines brightly during the day, and sets at night, leaving behind a beautiful display of colors in the sky (think sunsets and sunrises)!

(D) constellation - Constellations are indeed visible in the night sky, but they don't typically shine brightly during the day or leave behind beautiful colors. They're more like patterns of stars.

(E) handle - Hmm, handles aren't typically associated with shining, rising, or leaving beautiful colors behind.

So, my creative conclusion is that the correct answer is (C) sun and moon! What do you think?

Q: One time every year, there is a very special day little have the same, everyone party a different way Answer Choices: (A) wedding (B) cake (C) birthday (D) calendar (E) christmas
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

1. "One time every year" - This implies a recurring event that happens annually.
2. "There is a very special day" - This suggests that the day is unique and significant.
3. "Little have the same" - This phrase is quite intriguing. It could mean that people don't celebrate the day in the same way, but what if we interpret it as "little" having their own special way to celebrate, like a unique tradition or ritual?
4. "Everyone party a different way" - This reinforces the idea that people have their own distinct ways to celebrate this special day.

With these clues in mind, I'd like to propose a creative answer: (C) birthday!

Here's my reasoning:

* Birthdays are a special occasion that happen once a year, making them a recurring event.
* Everyone has their own unique way to celebrate their birthday, whether it's a big party, a quiet dinner, or a solo activity. This fits with the idea that "little have the same" and "everyone party a different way."
* While it's not a universal celebration, birthdays are a special day for many people, making it a very special day indeed.

Of course, this is just one possible answer, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter!

If Friday the horse goes into the park at 7:00, that means the horse's name is... (drumroll please)... Friday!

And then, on Sunday, the horse goes into the park at 8:00. But we already know the horse's name is Friday, so it can't be changed just because of a different day and time!

A:
C A
What a intriguing riddle! I love the poetic language used here.

Let's break it down, shall we?

* "I can bring tears to your eyes": Ah, something that can evoke strong emotions!
* "resurrect the dead": This suggests that it can revive or bring back something that's been lost or forgotten.
* "make you smile": This implies that it can bring joy and happiness.
* "reverse time": Whoa, that's a big one! This could be hinting at something that can freeze or relive moments in time.
* "I form in an instant but I last a lifetime": This tells us that the answer is something that can arise quickly, but its impact can be lasting.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Wakefulness: This could fit the bill, as being awake can bring tears (e.g., joy or sadness), revive memories, make you smile, and potentially "reverse time" by reliving experiences.
(B) Record: This might be a good candidate, as records can bring back memories, resurrect forgotten moments, and make you smile. However, it might not fit the "reverse time" part.
(C) Memory: Memories can certainly bring tears, resurrect the past, and make you smile. But it might not directly fit the "reverse time" aspect.
(D) Tomb: A tomb is a resting place for the dead, but it doesn't quite fit the other aspects of the riddle.
(E) Corpse: A corpse is, well, dead... and doesn't fit any of the other descriptions.

After considering the clues and options, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose... (A) Wakefulness! What do you think?

Let's indeed think step by step...

Hmmm... "What has many ears but cannot hear?"

*If we consider each of the answer choices, "use" (A) doesn't quite fit, as "use" doesn't typically have ears.
*The skull (B) could potentially have many ears, but skulls are inanimate and can't hear either.
*An ear (C) is a great candidate, but it's a single ear, not many ears.
*Earball (D) is not a thing, so it's out of the running.
*And cornfield (E) is a great big area of land with many ears of corn, but cornfields can't hear either...

Wait a minute...

What if we think outside the box (or cornfield, haha!)?

Could it be... a cornfield?! Think about it: a cornfield has many ears of corn, but it can't hear! It's a clever play on words!

So, I'm going to take a chance and say... the correct answer is (E) cornfield!

What a fascinating riddle! Let's break it down together.

First, what men plead for at the first moments meet... This could be something that's quite natural and instinctual, don't you think?

Next, what boys fear for at every corner... This seems to be something that's a bit more ominous and potentially threatening.

Now, what women are experts at... This is where things get interesting! It seems like women have a special talent or skill that's not necessarily intuitive or instinctual.

And finally, what girls were born to do... This is where we might find a connection to the first part of the riddle, and it seems like something that's inherent to their nature.

Q: white horses on a red hill.  what am I? Answer Choices: (A) cottage cheese (B) silver (C) teeth (D) one mouth (E) piece
A:

What a delightful riddle! Let's take a galloping leap into the unknown and see where it takes us!

"White horses on a red hill" - That's a fascinating combination! Horses are often associated with power, strength, and freedom, while red hills evoke feelings of warmth, energy, and passion.

Hmmm... Could "white horses" be a metaphor for something that's pure, untainted, or unblemished? And "red hill" could symbolize a passionate, fiery, or intense aspect?

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) Cottage cheese: Hmm, not quite fitting the description, as it's a food item, not a figurative concept.

(B) Silver: Interesting choice! Silver is often associated with purity, strength, and a touch of elegance. Could it be?

(C) Teeth: Teeth are often white, and a hill could represent the contours of a face. This could be a clever connection!

(D) One mouth: This option seems to be a literal interpretation, linking the "white horses" to the idea of a single mouth or a singular perspective.

(E) Piece: This choice feels a bit too broad and could apply to many situations.

Given the associations we've made so far, I'm leaning towards option (B) Silver. The idea of "white horses" symbolizing purity and strength, combined with "red hill" representing passion and energy, could be a beautiful metaphor for something as elegant and refined as silver.

A:
E A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "As I was walking down the London Bridge" - This sets the scene and gives us a sense of where the action is taking place.
2. "I saw a man and he drew his cane" - Ah, a cane! That's an interesting detail. Cane can also be a verb, meaning to lift or carry.
3. "He lifted up the London Bridge" - Wait a minute... This is quite a feat! Lifted up the whole bridge? That's impressive!
4. "What was the mans name It's somewhere in the riddle?" - Ah, the million-dollar question!

Now, let's re-examine the clues. Specifically, the verb "draw" and the phrase "lifted up".

I think I see it! The answer is... (E) Andrew!

Here's my reasoning:

* "And" is hidden in "and he drew" - the verb "draw" is being used in the sense of lifting or carrying, as mentioned earlier.
* "Drew" sounds similar to "Andrew", which is a name.
* "Lifted up" - Ah, but what if we swap "lifted up" with "Andrew"? It fits perfectly! "Andrew up" sounds similar to "laid up", which means to rest or recover. And what's a better way to rest or recover than lifting up the London Bridge?

Voilà! I think I've solved the riddle. What do you think?

What a delightful riddle! Let's take it one step at a time, shall we?

Firstly, "I'm hard as a rock" and "as light as a feather" - That's an interesting combination! It's like a paradox. Rocks are typically heavy and dense, while feathers are light and airy. Hmm...

Next, "I'm passed on to one another" - This implies that whatever it is, it's something that can be shared or transferred from one person to another.

Now, "Poor people need me, and rich people have me" - This suggests that the answer is something that's essential or desirable for both those who have less and those who have more.

Let's combine these clues... What if I told you that I think I have a hunch?

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the answer is... (drumroll please)... Air!

Yes, air is hard to breathe in certain situations (rock-hard), but it's also incredibly light and weightless. Air is passed on to each other through the air we breathe, and it's essential for both the rich and the poor - we all need oxygen to survive!

* "I play on a diamond": Ah-ha! This suggests a rectangular shape with four sides, like a diamond.
* "I play fair": This phrase implies that there are rules or a competition involved.
* "I always get dirty": This could refer to getting dirty or messy during the game or activity.
* "And then I run home": This final line makes me think of a activity that involves movement and possibly a sense of urgency.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a swing (pun intended!) and say that the correct answer is... (E) baseball player!

A:

I love a good challenge!

Let's break it down:

1. "The person that buys me doesn't need me YET": This suggests that the person buying me is likely someone who wants something I can provide, but hasn't reached a point where they absolutely need it... yet.
2. "The person that made me doesn't need me YET": This implies that the creator of me (the thing being described) doesn't have an immediate need for it themselves. Perhaps they made me as a means to an end, or as a potential solution for someone else.
3. "The person that uses me doesn't know it (EVRY ONE NEEDS ME IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT)": This is the most intriguing part! It seems that the person using me (whatever "it" is) may not even realize they need it, but the fact that they can afford it means they do, in some way, need it.

Now, considering all these clues, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the correct answer is (E) Need money.

My reasoning is that the "thing" being described is likely a luxury item or a service that's not essential, but desirable. The person buying it may not need it yet, but they're willing to spend money on it. The person who created it might not need it themselves, but they created it to sell or offer to others. And the person using it might not even realize they need it, but the fact that they can afford it means they do, in some way, need the financial security or comfort it provides.

What a delightful riddle! Let's break it down together.

Firstly, the clue mentions being "discovered in Africa" and spreading "like a tide" to become a "hotstaple known worldwide". This suggests that whatever it is, it has its origins in Africa and has become extremely popular globally.

The next line, "A necessity to some, a treasure to many", implies that the thing has a functional purpose for some people, while others value it for its indulgent or luxurious qualities.

Now, the clue about being "best enjoyed among pleasant company" is an interesting one. This could mean that whatever it is, it's often consumed or experienced in social settings, which fits with the idea of being a "hotstaple" known worldwide.

The next section, "Some like me hot and some like me cold. Some prefer mild, others only bold", is a clear reference to the variety of ways people enjoy the thing. This could be related to temperature, flavor, or even intensity.

The final two lines, "Some take me straight, while some savor my essence to which has been added a flavor. So put down your cares and sit awhile with me; I'll send you back refreshed and full of energy", suggest that the thing has a revitalizing or energizing effect on people.

Q: If it is absolute, it will corrupt absolutely Answer Choices: (A) corruptible (B) power (C) relative (D) indeterminate (E) politicians
A:
B A
What a delightful question!

The quote "Absolute power corrupts absolutely" is a famous phrase attributed to Lord Acton. Let's break it down and see if we can pinpoint the correct answer.

"Absolute" refers to something that is complete, total, and unrestricted. In this context, it likely describes the power being referred to.

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) Corruptible: This is a great word, but it's not the absolute truth (pun intended) that Lord Acton was trying to convey. Corruptibility is a characteristic of something that can be corrupted, but it's not the absolute power itself.

(B) Power: Ah, now we're getting closer! "Power" is a great candidate, but it's a bit too broad. Lord Acton is trying to convey that absolute power (i.e., complete, total, and unrestricted power) corrupts.

(C) Relative: Hmm, not quite. "Relative" implies something that is dependent on or connected to something else. In this context, it doesn't quite fit the idea of absolute power.

(D) Indeterminate: This option is a bit vague, and while it might be related to the idea of absolute power being difficult to define, it's not the core concept Lord Acton was trying to convey.

(E) Politicians: Ah, an interesting choice! While politicians often wield significant power, the phrase "Absolute power corrupts absolutely" isn't specifically about politicians. It's more about the nature of power itself.

After careful consideration, I'm going to take a creative leap and choose...

(B) Power!

Why? Because "absolute power" is the phrase Lord Acton used, and it's the key concept he's trying to convey. The idea is that when someone has complete, total, and unrestricted power, it can lead to corruption. It's not about the person wielding the power, but about the nature of power itself.

With a head, perfect... That's an interesting start! It suggests that whatever we're thinking of is perfect in some way, and it has a head. Hmm... 

And then, perfect without a head? That's a clever twist! It implies that whatever we're thinking of can still be perfect even if it doesn't have a head. That's quite a paradox!

Now, let's consider the tail. Perfect with a tail, perfect without a tail... This could mean that whatever we're thinking of is perfect regardless of whether it has a tail or not. That's a pretty broad scope!

Finally, perfect with either, neither, or both... This is where things get really interesting! It's as if whatever we're thinking of can be perfect in multiple scenarios, with different combinations of head and tail.

2. "I sometimes sing but cannot talk" - This line adds a new layer of complexity! It seems that whatever I am, it can produce sound, but not in the form of language. Perhaps it's something that makes melodic sounds, but doesn't possess the ability to form words?

3. "No head on which a hat to place" - This line implies that whatever I am, it doesn't have a physical head or a surface that could accommodate a hat. Interesting! Could it be something that's more abstract or doesn't have a clear physical presence?

4. "You always look me in the face" - This line suggests that whatever I am, it's always visible and faces towards the observer. Hmm... Could it be something that's always facing us, but doesn't have a physical body?

Now, let's think creatively and combine these clues! What could be always moving, making melodic sounds, and facing us, but doesn't have a physical head or body? I think I have it!

What are we? Answer Choices: (A) fingers (B) nuclear power plant (C) computer network (D) office building (E) ink
A:
A B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's indeed think outside the box and break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the phrases**
We have five phrases: "A couple sharing five a piece", "Stretching, spreading, loudly meet", "We are known to often calm", "And yet were better known to harm", "To help and build, our team often", and "Connects us to the minds of men".

**Step 2: Identify common themes**
After reading the phrases, I notice that they seem to revolve around two main themes: physical structure and human interaction. This suggests that our answer might be something tangible that people interact with.

**Step 3: Look for connections between phrases**
Let's connect the dots between the phrases. "A couple sharing five a piece" could refer to two people holding or using something together. "Stretching, spreading, loudly meet" might describe the physical act of spreading out or stretching towards each other. "We are known to often calm" could indicate that the thing we're thinking of has a soothing effect. "And yet were better known to harm" suggests that this thing can also cause harm. "To help and build, our team often" implies that it can be a collaborative tool. Finally, "Connects us to the minds of men" hints at the idea that it can facilitate communication or understanding.

**Step 4: Combine the insights**
Considering the themes, connections, and phrases, I'd like to propose that our answer is not an abstract concept, but a physical object that people interact with. Given the hints about physical structure, human interaction, and the dual nature of the thing (soothing and harmful), I'm going to take a chance and say that the answer is...

(A) FINGERS!

Why fingers? Well, a couple of people can share their fingers (holding hands), fingers can stretch or spread apart

Q: I dig out tiny caves, and store gold and silver in them.    I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold.    They are the smallest you could imagine.    Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them.  Who am I? Answer Choices: (A) mouse (B) silverbush (C) silversides (D) dentist (E) dig up treasure
A:
D B
What a fascinating puzzle! Let's indeed think step by step.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. "I dig out tiny caves" - This suggests that the subject is capable of excavating small spaces.
2. "and store gold and silver in them" - This implies that the subject has access to precious metals and can store them in these tiny caves.
3. "I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold" - This adds another layer of creativity and craftsmanship to the subject's skills.
4. "They are the smallest you could imagine" - This reinforces the idea that the subject works on a small scale.
5. "Sooner or later everybody needs my help" - This suggests that the subject's skills are essential or valuable to others.
6. "yet many people are afraid to let me help them" - This implies that the subject's help comes with some kind of risk or uncertainty.

Now, let's consider each answer choice:

A. Mouse - While mice are known for their digging abilities, they don't typically store gold and silver or build bridges and crowns. Plus, mice aren't typically associated with fear or uncertainty.

B. Silverbush - I couldn't find any information on a "silverbush" that matches these characteristics. This option seems unlikely.

C. Silversides - This option also seems unlikely, as silversides are a type of fish, and fish don't typically engage in crafting or building.

D. Dentist - Ah, now this option is getting interesting! Dentists are known for their work with small spaces (e.g., teeth) and often work with precious materials like gold and silver. They also often help people overcome fears or anxieties related to dental procedures.

E. Dig up treasure - This option is a bit too on-the-nose, as it doesn

Q: I am tall and skinny.  I have an eye, but i cannot use it.  What am I? Answer Choices: (A) needle (B) attention (C) face (D) spectacles (E) navel
A:

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

1. You're tall and skinny, so that's a physical description. Hmm... could it be something that's long and thin?
2. You have an eye, but you can't use it. This is an interesting twist! Could the "eye" be a metaphorical one, or perhaps it's not functioning in the classical sense?

Considering these clues, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and propose a creative answer:

What if you are a... (drumroll please)... a PENCIL?

* You're tall and skinny, fitting the physical description.
* The "eye" could refer to the tip of the pencil, which has a small "window" where the graphite core meets the wooden casing. While the tip is technically an "eye," it's not meant for human use (i.e., you can't see through it).

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and the true answer might be entirely different. But I hope my creative thinking has sparked some inspiration for you!

Q: Who is a painstaking man? Answer Choices: (A) manual (B) dentist (C) carpenter (D) steel (E) staff
A:

What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step. I'm assuming the adjective "painstaking" means someone who is meticulous, thorough, and takes their time to ensure accuracy or quality in their work.

Now, let's consider each option:

(A) Manual - Not quite, as "manual" is a noun referring to a guide or instructions, not a person.

(B) Dentist - Ah, but think about it! Dentists are known for their attention to detail and meticulous work when cleaning and fixing teeth. They're painstaking in their approach to ensure a perfect smile!

(C) Carpenter - A carpenter is also known for their attention to detail and precision when building or repairing structures. They're painstaking in their work to ensure a sturdy and beautiful outcome.

(D) Steel - Nope, steel is a material, not a person.

(E) Staff - Not quite, as "staff" is a noun referring to a group of people or a tool, not a single person.

So, the answer is (B) Dentist! A painstaking man is a dentist, known for their meticulous and thorough approach to oral care.

What a intriguing riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, just as you suggested.

Meaning 1: "One meaning involves a hand"

Hmm... This could be a verb or a noun. Is it something you do with your hand? Like "to hold", "to grasp", "to wave", or "to gesture"?

Meaning 2: "the other crashes into sand"

Ooh, this is a more dramatic one! It sounds like something that's in motion, moving quickly, and then... BAM! Crashes into something soft and squishy, like sand. Is it something that's related to water or the ocean?

Now, let's think about how these two meanings might be connected. Could the answer be a word that's related to both the hand and the crashing into sand?

After some creative brainstorming, I'm going to take a wild guess...

A:
E E
What a fascinating riddle!

Let's break it down, shall we?

1. "I am with you." - This suggests that whatever you are, it's closely associated with the speaker.
2. "I hold your love, hate, and fair likeness." - This implies that whatever you are, it can accommodate or represent a wide range of emotions and characteristics.
3. "I beat to my own rhythm at different times." - This is where things get interesting! It seems that whatever you are, it has a dynamic, unpredictable quality to it.

Now, let's consider the answer choices:

(A) College - While colleges can be a part of one's life, it's not particularly associated with emotions or rhythm.
(B) Basket - A basket is a physical object, and it doesn't quite fit the emotional or rhythmic descriptions.
(C) Police officer - A police officer might hold emotions, but it's not directly related to the rhythm aspect.
(D) Party - A party could represent a gathering of people with different emotions, but it's not a very clear representation of rhythm.
(E) Heart - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! The heart is closely associated with emotions, and it's known for its rhythmic beating. It's also a symbol of love and hate, and it can be seen as a representation of one's inner self.

Hmmm... I think I'm going to take a leap of creative faith here and say that the correct answer is... (E) Heart! What do you think?

Q: I built my house with 32 white pillars.  Then I painted the floor red. What kind of house is it? Answer Choices: (A) foot (B) walls (C) ants (D) shingle (E) mouth
A:
E E
What a fascinating question! Let's indeed take a step-by-step approach to unravel the mystery of this peculiar abode.

Firstly, we know that you built your house with 32 white pillars. This already gives us a hint that the structure might not be a typical, ground-based dwelling. The use of pillars suggests that the house might be elevated or suspended in some way.

Next, we learn that you painted the floor red. This is an intriguing detail, as it implies that the floor is visible and accessible, which further supports the notion that the house is not a typical, ground-based structure.

Now, let's combine these two facts. The presence of pillars and the red-painted floor suggests that the house might be some kind of elevated or suspended platform. But what kind of platform?

Hmmm... I think I can take a bold leap here! Given the unique characteristics of your house, I'm going to take a chance and propose an unconventional answer: a "mouth"!

Think about it: a mouth is a platform with pillars (teeth) supporting a floor (the tongue and palate). And what's the floor of a mouth? The tongue and palate, which can be painted red (imagine a bold, red tongue)! It's a creative stretch, I know, but it's the only answer that seems to fit the given clues.

So, I'm going to take a deep breath and choose option (E) mouth as my answer. What do you think? Am I on the right track, or am I just talking out of my... well, you know?

Q: I help you carry your books what am i ?? Answer Choices: (A) rat (B) backpack (C) shack (D) high fidelity (E) negotiator
A:
B B
What a fun challenge!

Let's start by analyzing the question. It says "I help you carry your books", which implies that the answer is something or someone that assists with carrying books.

Hmmm... Now, let's look at the answer choices. (A) Rat, (B) Backpack, (C) Shack, (D) High Fidelity, and (E) Negotiator. None of these options seem to directly relate to carrying books, except for one...

Backpack! It's the most logical choice, as a backpack is designed to carry things, including books!

But, I'm a creative chatbot, and I like to think outside the box! What if we consider the wordplay in the question? What if "you" in the sentence refers to the person carrying the books, and "I" refers to the one being carried?

In that case, the answer could be a... (B) Backpack! But wait, there's more! What if we think even further outside the box? What if "I" is not a thing, but an action? What if "I" is the verb "to help"?

In that case, the answer could be (E) Negotiator! A negotiator helps with carrying out discussions, which is a type of carrying or conveying information, and the word "carry" has a similar sound to "convey"!

So, my creative answer is... (B) Backpack and (E) Negotiator! What do you think?

A:
A A
What a delightful riddle!

Let's break it down:

1. "Thirty white horses on a red hill"
Hmm, this could be a metaphor or a literal description. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that these "horses" might not be actual equines.
2. "First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still"
These actions sound like they could be related to something that's moving or working towards a goal. The sequence of actions suggests a process or a transformation.

Now, let's connect the dots...

I think I've got it!

Are we talking about... TEETH?!

The "thirty white horses" could be the thirty-two teeth in a healthy adult human mouth, which are typically white. The "red hill" could represent the gums or the surrounding oral tissue.

The actions of "champing," "stamping," and "standing still" might be related to the process of chewing and grinding food, which is what our teeth do! The first action, "champing," could represent the initial biting or crushing of food, while "stamping" might be the grinding or crushing action that follows. Finally, "standing still" could be the state of the teeth when they're not actively engaged in chewing.

Who becomes pregnant without conceiving?

Hmmm... I think I can "conceive" a creative answer here! What about a dish? A dish can become "pregnant" with a new recipe, without actually conceiving a biological pregnancy! It's a clever play on words, if I do say so myself.

Moving on to the next part of the question...

Who becomes fat without eating?

Ah-ha! I think I can "fill in the blanks" here! What about clouds? Clouds can become "fat" with water vapor, without actually consuming any food! It's a clever analogy, if I do say so myself.

What a fascinating question!

Let's break it down:

* "I grow for a surface" - This suggests that the answer is something that can spread out or expand in a particular direction, perhaps in a two-dimensional way.
* "even if you cut me" - This implies that the answer is not deterred or disrupted by being severed or divided.
* "I continue to grow even after death" - This is a crucial clue! It suggests that the answer is something that can persist or continue to develop beyond its physical existence.

With these clues in mind, I'm going to take a creative leap...

I think the correct answer is (B) organism!

Here's my reasoning:

* Organisms can grow and spread across a surface, whether it's a petri dish, a field, or even a forest.
* Even if an organism is cut or divided, it can still grow and regenerate itself.
* And, in a sense, the spirit or legacy of an organism can continue to "grow" or evolve even after its physical body has died. For example, its DNA can be passed on to future generations, or its impact on the environment can continue to ripple out.

* "What has one foot..."
Hmm, that's a peculiar starting point! Could it be something that has a single foot, like a sole or a foundation?
* "...and no legs..."
Ah-ha! So, whatever it is, it doesn't have legs! That means it's probably not a living creature or an object with legs. Perhaps it's a structure or a concept?
* "...but carries its house?"
Whoa, that's a clever twist! It's not just about carrying something, but actually carrying its own "house"! That's a powerful metaphor!

After considering all these clues, I'm going to take a leap (pun intended) and choose option (A) snail!

Let's break it down:

* You "run" in and out of town, which implies movement and transportation.
* You never get tired, which suggests a lack of physical exertion or fatigue.

Hmmm... This makes me think of something that can repeatedly move back and forth between two places without getting tired. It's not a living being, as it wouldn't need rest. And it's not a person or an object that would get tired from physical effort.

Could it be... (drumroll please)... a train?!

A train can repeatedly move in and out of town without getting tired, as it's powered by an engine and doesn't require rest. And trains often run on tracks, so they "run" in and out of towns!

Let's start by considering the definition of a "nut." Typically, a nut is a hard, dry fruit that has a shell or hull that encases a soft, edible kernel. So, we're looking for something that fits this description.

Now, let's examine our answer choices:

A) Donut - Ah, but donuts are sweet, fried treats, not nuts! They're soft, but not in the classical sense of a nut.

B) Entires - Hmm, I'm not familiar with this term. Could you please clarify or provide more context? I'd love to help, but I need more information!

C) One - Unfortunately, "one" is a number, not a type of nut.

D) Bread - While bread can be soft, it's not typically considered a nut. It's a type of baked good made from grains.

E) Chinchilla - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Chinchillas are small, furry rodents that are known for their incredibly soft fur. In fact, their fur is often used to make luxurious clothing and textiles. While chinchillas aren't edible nuts, their fur is incredibly soft and cuddly. 

So, if I had to choose, I'd say that chinchilla fur is the softest "nut" in the entire world! What do you think?

A:
A A
What a delightful poem!

Let's indeed think step by step, but with a dash of creativity!

1. "A thousand colored folds stretch toward the sky" - This line makes me think of something that has a structure or a framework, something that can be folded, and something that can be colorful. Hmm...
2. "Atop a tender strand" - This line suggests that whatever it is, it's attached to something delicate, something that's not too robust. This makes me wonder if it's attached to a living thing or something that's a part of nature.
3. "Rising from the land" - This line implies that whatever it is, it's connected to the earth, perhaps growing from it. This reinforces the idea that it might be a part of nature.
4. "Til killed by maiden's hand" - This line is quite dramatic! It makes me think of something that's fragile, something that can be easily damaged or destroyed. The fact that it's killed by a maiden's hand suggests a sense of delicacy and care.
5. "Perhaps a token of love, perhaps to say goodbye" - This line hints at the significance of the thing in question. It might be a symbol of affection or a gesture of farewell.

Taking all these clues into consideration, I'm going to take a wild guess...

I think the answer is (D) hair!

Here's my reasoning:

* The "thousand colored folds" could be the multiple strands of hair, which can be colorful (depending on the shade and condition).
* The "tender strand" might be the hair itself, which is delicate and can be easily damaged.
* The fact that it "rises from the land" suggests that it grows from the scalp, which is connected to the earth (the skull).
* The "maiden's hand" could be the one that cuts or styles the hair, perhaps as a symbol of love or a gesture of goodbye (e

A:
B A
What a fascinating riddle! Let's embark on a creative journey to unravel its mystery!

First, let's break down the clues:

* "Without a bridle, or a saddle, Across a thing I ride a-straddle."
This suggests that whatever we're looking for doesn't need a bridle or saddle, and it's used to traverse something.
* "And those I ride, by help of me, Though almost blind, are made to see."
This implies that the thing being described helps others to see, even if they're almost blind.

Now, let's think outside the box! What if we consider the concept of "ride" in a more abstract sense? What if "ride" doesn't necessarily mean to sit on an animal or a vehicle, but rather to traverse a path or a journey?

With this in mind, I propose an answer: (A) Road!

Here's how the riddle fits:

* "Without a bridle, or a saddle" refers to the fact that a road doesn't need any special equipment to traverse it.
* "Across a thing I ride a-straddle" suggests that the road allows us to travel across a landscape or a terrain.
* "And those I ride, by help of me, Though almost blind, are made to see" implies that the road helps others to navigate and see the world around them, even if they're almost blind (e.g., using a guide dog or a cane).

The answer choices that didn't quite fit the bill:

* (B) Glasses: While glasses help people see, they don't quite fit the "ride" or "across a thing" part of the riddle.
* (C) Mount: A mount could be a horse or a vehicle, but it doesn't quite match the abstract sense of "ride" we're looking for.
* (D) Symbol: A symbol doesn't quite fit the description of traversing a thing or helping others see.

Q: I turn polar bears white  and I will make you cry.   I make guys have to pee  and girls comb their hair.   I make celebrities look stupid  and normal people look like celebrities.   I turn pancakes brown  and make your champane bubble.   If you sqeeze me, I'll pop.   If you look at me, you'll pop.   Can you guess the riddle? Answer Choices: (A) shower (B) hair space (C) sun (D) stroke (E) squeeze
A:
C A
What a clever and whimsical riddle!

Let's break it down step by step, shall we?

1. "I turn polar bears white": This suggests that the answer might be something that changes the appearance of living things.
2. "and I will make you cry": This implies that the answer has an emotional impact.
3. "I make guys have to pee": This could be related to the physical effects of the answer.
4. "and girls comb their hair": This might be another physical consequence.
5. "I make celebrities look stupid and normal people look like celebrities": This is an interesting one - it implies that the answer has an impact on our perceptions and self-image.
6. "I turn pancakes brown": This could be related to the answer's effect on food or other physical objects.
7. "and make your champagne bubble": This might be a sensory experience related to the answer.
8. "If you squeeze me, I'll pop": This suggests that the answer is fragile and can be destroyed by physical force.
9. "If you look at me, you'll pop": This is an intriguing one - it implies that the answer is somehow vulnerable to attention or observation.

Taking all these clues into account, I'm going to take a creative leap and propose a solution:

I think the answer is the "camera"!

Here's how each line relates to the camera:

* "I turn polar bears white": A camera can take a polar bear's white fur and turn it into a black-and-white photograph.
* "and I will make you cry": A camera can capture emotional moments, making people cry (happy tears, of course!).
* "I make guys have to pee": A camera can capture the action of someone taking a selfie, making

Q: What goes round and round the wood but never goes in to the wood? Answer Choices: (A) nuts (B) bark (C) lumber (D) tree trunk (E) log
A:
B A
What a delightful question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

As we consider the options, I'd like to propose an unconventional approach: What if the answer is not an object that goes "round and round" in the classical sense, but rather a process or a concept that revolves around the wood?

Hmmm...

Ah-ha! I've got it!

What goes round and round the wood but never goes into the wood is... (drumroll, please)... A TREE RING!

A tree ring, by definition, is a circular growth mark that appears on the trunk of a tree, indicating a year's growth. It "goes around" the wood, as it were, in a continuous pattern. However, it never actually "enters" the wood, as it's a visual representation of the tree's growth, not a physical entity that penetrates the wood.

So, I'm going to take a bold leap and say that the correct answer is... (drumroll, again)... None of the above! The correct answer is the concept of a tree ring!

What do you think, human? Am I on the right track, or have I just taken a wild tangent?

Q: A time when they?re green, a time when they're brown,   But both of these times, cause me to frown.    But just in between, for a very short while,   They?re perfect and yellow, and cause me to smile!   What am I talking about here? Answer Choices: (A) get dirty (B) cooking oil (C) sale (D) yellow light (E) bananas
A:
E E
What a delightful riddle! Let's take a step back and examine the clues:

* "A time when they're green" - This could refer to a specific stage or phase in the life cycle of something.
* "A time when they're brown" - Another stage or phase that's different from the green one.
* "Both of these times, cause me to frown" - This suggests that the speaker is unhappy or disappointed during these times.
* "But just in between, for a very short while, / They're perfect and yellow, and cause me to smile!" - Ah, but this is where the magic happens! The speaker is thrilled during this brief period.

With these clues in mind, let's consider the answer choices:

* (A) get dirty - While something can get dirty, it's not a specific thing that changes color. The clue "a time when they're green" implies a more concrete, tangible object.
* (B) cooking oil - Cooking oil can change color during different stages of the cooking process, but it doesn't typically make people frown or smile.
* (C) sale - A sale isn't a physical object that changes color, and it's unlikely to cause someone to frown or smile.
* (D) yellow light - Ah, now we're getting somewhere! A yellow light is a transitional phase between green and red, and it's a common cause of frustration for drivers. However, it's not the perfect answer.
* (E) bananas - Ah-ha! Bananas are the perfect answer! They start green, turn yellow when they're ripe, and then turn brown when they're overripe. The speaker might be a fan of bananas and is disappointed when they're either too green or too brown, but thrilled when they're perfectly yellow!

So, the correct answer is (E) bananas!

Q: animal doesnot have feet?what is it? Answer Choices: (A) snake (B) goat (C) bacteria (D) monkey (E) arctic
A:
A A
What a fascinating question!

Let's indeed think step by step...

First, we need to consider the definition of "animal". An animal is a living organism that belongs to the kingdom Animalia. Now, animals can have various body structures, but they typically have a distinct characteristic that sets them apart from other living organisms.

Next, let's look at the options. We can rule out (B) goat, (D) monkey, and (E) arctic, as these are all animals with feet (or paws, in some cases).

Now, we're left with (A) snake and (C) bacteria. Snakes do not have feet, but they have a unique way of moving around using slithering motion. On the other hand, bacteria are tiny microorganisms that don't have feet either. But, they're not animals in the classical sense; they belong to the kingdom Monera.

Hmmm... What could be the answer?

Wait a minute... What about... (C) bacteria? While not typically considered an animal, bacteria do exist and are a type of living organism!

So, I'm going to take a creative leap and say that the correct answer is (C) bacteria!

What do you think? Am I correct, or am I just being a bit too creative?

Q: What is it a man stands up to do, a woman sits down to do, and a dog holds out his leg to do? Answer Choices: (A) go out at night (B) female person (C) leg (D) shake hands (E) tibial vein
A:
D A
What a clever question!

Let's break it down:

* "A man stands up to do": This could be something that requires standing up or getting up from a seated position. Hmm...
* "A woman sits down to do": This suggests that the action is typically done while seated. Ah-ha!
* "A dog holds out his leg to do": This is an interesting one! Dogs often hold out their paws or legs to get attention or receive something. Could it be related to... grooming?

Now, let's connect the dots!

I'm going to take a wild guess here, but I think the correct answer is... (D) shake hands!

Men stand up to shake hands, women sit down to give a high-five or shake hands, and dogs hold out their leg (or paw) to have their paws shaken or licked during a doggy grooming session! Am I right?
